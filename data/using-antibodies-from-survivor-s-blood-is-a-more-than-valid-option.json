You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Using antibodies from survivors of ebola is actually a pretty simple idea. It works just like a vaccine, except instead of encouraging your own body to make the antibodies, you use someone else's. With that in mind, you could not only help those infected fight the disease, but, if it's successful, also immunize those who may come in contact with Ebola.\n<br/> I understand the hesitation to even think about a cure before we can even figure out how many people are infected or how to track and contain them. I do think, however, that we should push for continuation of developing this idea becasue we can minimize the risk to others and slow the spread.\n<br/> Here is the \n<a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/08/who-ponders-treating-ebola-infected-people-blood-survivors\">link</a> for the article if anyone is interested.\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
