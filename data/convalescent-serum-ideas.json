The problem as I understand it is 1) how to safely donate blood and take care of it given available conditions/equipment and 2) channel the black market donation of survival blood into controlled care-centers.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            These are my thoughts about the proposed idea of the use of Convalescent Serum.\u00a0 I believe that this idea is very good start to finding a useable vaccine to the Ebola virus.\u00a0 We have evidence that this serum from Ebola survivors is effective in some patients suffering from the disease.\u00a0 There is however, a controversy of whether or not the survivors would want to donate their blood.\u00a0 I propose that we provide incentives of necessities such as water and nutritional food for the survivors.\u00a0 This idea would hopefully result in more participation in survivor donations, therefore leading to more patients being treated.\n        </div>",
