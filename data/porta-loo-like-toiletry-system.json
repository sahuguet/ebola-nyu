I like very much this simple and clever idea for portable toilets.Vanessa Counaert, whose project is featured today, just encouraged me to share with you this project I wrote some time ago to treat human waste: http://papirofilia.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/a-propos-des-toilettes-seches-urbaines/I think many of the ideas that are being shared in this forum can be connected, a system like yours being the first end of the chain, then a distribution network and a treatment network. What do you think about this?\n    "

Here's some tips to get your started - http://ideo.pn/pr0t0type. Perhaps somethings to consider are:- How would we dispose of this, would the whole bucket me thrown away?- What kind of sanitization mechanisms would you use if the bucket was to be kept?- How can we protect the caregivers disposing of this waste, since the patients are unlikely to be the ones doing this?- How can we easily distribute these kits to households that need them?We're looking forward to seeing this idea grow!\n    "
