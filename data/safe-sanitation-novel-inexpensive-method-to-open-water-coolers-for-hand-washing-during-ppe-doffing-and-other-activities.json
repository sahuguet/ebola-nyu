The bulb can be housed inside of a foot pedal, which can be mass manufactured at very low cost (three components) or fashioned locally from inexpensive materials.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> photo credit :\u00a0http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/finding-visible-hope-amid-ebolas-invisible-danger/?_r=0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Washing of hands is an important method for infection control at all times, and is especially true during the Ebola outbreak. Water coolers are used instead of running water in many Ebola treatment wards in West Africa. Proposed is a novel pneumatic valve that can be activated with a foot pedal and made from a simple blood pressure cuff.",
