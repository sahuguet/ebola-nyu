Virus do not have these so the process would have to tell something different.  Perhaps the virus changes the mitochondria enough that the test could tell if it has been compromised.\n    "

What would be useful is designing a set of probes for the most conserved regions in Ebola that do not align with anything else in the sample.\n    "

You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"
