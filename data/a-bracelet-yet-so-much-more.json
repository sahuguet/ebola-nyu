The mindset of the people with the bracelet will make the people heal themselves through brain power. Our brains are powerful enough to cure sicknesses, but sometimes it is hard to do that until we fully believe it. There are some problems with the fact that the cure might not be 100% guaranteed, but I can make a page that lets the owner of the bracelet know that the cure might not be guaranteed, but that it is key to stay positive.\n        </div>",
