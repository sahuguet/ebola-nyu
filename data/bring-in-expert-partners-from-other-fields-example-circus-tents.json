      "message": "\n    \t\"Camp in box\" is proposed on this site and can be made to fit the need (as well as scale cost. Hawk mining in Sierra Leone (Western District) uses and moves shipping containers through out West Africa and is at the current time is housing fiberoptic cable across into Liberia. There is a Pakistani company that can make shipping containers to order which is cheaper than some of these other groups but with Hawk Mining in the area, it seems more prudent to approach them, they have windows, AC as below. Yurts: www.yurts.com....that is all I can think of at the moment. Again, however, NGOs are also good at setting up quickly. DoD will be months behind in \"building clinics\" which eventually will be used for other things. Again, we need to understand why patients aren't going to the clinics....several have closed due to the fear the community has of these clinics.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tI work quite a lot in Africa,  we use shipping containers for moving equipment around in East and West Africa.  When emptied, the containers become workshops and control rooms.  We have modified the containers to fit removable Air Conditioning units, making the containers very useable.  If the containers are well painted internally, the only issue is the floors, they would need to be sealed to allow water run-off.  The containers can be tilted with a few degrees of angle either on their trailers or on the ground, this would allow fluid run-off when cleaning.  Sealing the floors is important, as they can be toxic with insecticide repellants.Even in the hottest point of the day, it is possible to get the internal temperature down to a manageable temperature.  The further northern parts of West Africa can be an issue, once temps hit +45 deg C. they can challenge the efficiency of the A/C's.-  We paint all our containers white to help with the sun, but for a long(ish) set-up a fly sheet arrangement over the container helps keep direct sunlight off the roof, and creates an air flow around the container.  - With used shipping containers we are really talking about relatively cheap equipment, even new they are very affordable.  There are many companies making some very sophisticated units out of them, but even a simple conversion makes for a viable workspace.  Military style casing (Pelicase Storm or other) or Flight-Cases make good storage units as well as work surfaces/benches while protecting equipment in transit over variable road conditions (Big Pot Holes!) Simple options for containers could be:Personnel access doors built into the cargo doors.Internal Isolation / Security doors inside the Cargo DoorsExtra Security measures externally (Locks/alarms.)Sealable Air Conditioner Cutouts for Air conditionersWaterproof wiring and LightingDrop down folding benches and shelving.Containers can be accommodation units, Kitchen Units, Ablution Blocks, Comms Centers, Laboratories, Recycling/cleaning units/Security & Control, the list is quite extensive.There are various methods of working the containers, they can be left on trailers, or dropped onto the ground, they can be interlocked vertically and horizontally making for complex arrangements long term of short term.  Their robust nature makes for a long life span, they can be cut,welded,modified they will withstand a lot of abuse, and at the end of a project they can be given away! Once modified, they are no longer sea worthy, so some consideration is needed for their disposal.\n    "
