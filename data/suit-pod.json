  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Another idea based on a wall of plastic and a suit. This one-piece suit has a pod-like bag in the back that can be deployed and attached to a wall. Then it can serve as a tunnel so the doctor can enter and exit the suit without touching it. Also, it can provide temporary ventilation when suits are too hot to work on them.\n<br/>\n<br/> Afterwards, if a suit needs to be cleaned or discarded, it can be turned inside-out from the other side of the wall (and detached) so in any moment doctors are in direct contact with the contaminated surfaces of the suit.\n        </div>",
