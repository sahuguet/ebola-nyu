      "message": "\n    \tAs a use of cutting edge technology (bio-tech), I find this idea quite compelling. I have some key questions (some of which may have already occurred to you):1] What experiments (using this tech or similar tech) have been conducted to date? Also: controlling the pore size/diameter would seem to be crucial -- can uniform and exact nano-pore size be assured/controlled? Also: Molybdenum is crucial for key cellular (synthesis) processes, but too much can disrupt cells...How can non-contamination (of a healthcare provider) by such a nano-material (and its constituent nano-particles) be assured (i.e., the safety of material)?2] Manufacturing/fabricating nano-materials can be http://expensive...is there an existing estimate of the cost per face mask or 'suit'? Is there an estimate of cost (and cost reduction per unit) after scaling up the fabrication process? How easily/readily scalable is the material design?3] Molybdenum is a relatively rare metal -- How is this metal element to be sourced? (supplied?)\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tDear Mr. Ricciardi,Thank you very much for your questions. Very much appreciated. I am interested to find a cheap pores material, such as poly lactic acid (PLA) for example ($1 square meter). The pores diameter can be sized according to the concentration of both  poly lactic and gamma glutamic acid (which gives the hydrophylicity of PLA) in water.  Further the resulted pores  are filled instead of water, with  high concentration of sodium or potassium chloride which result into an osmotic shock for the virus capsid, expelling the virus RNA. the end codon of RNA  can be blocked by the acids I mentioned in the written idea, thus stopping the protein translation and finally protein synthesis.  Everything at this stage is based on a very comprehensive literature search.  The material is safe for the healthcare workers. \u00a0I never said anything about molybdenum. I uploaded a nice picture from a website and it was my obligation to wrote the website from where this picture was obtained.Thank you again for the inquiry. I actually intended today to explain more about the ebola killing  process at the spot.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tWell, further explication/clarification of the actual mechanism(s) involved here:\"The pores will be covalently bound to 3 methyl-antranilic acid or indol 3 -propionic acid, which inhibit the growth of  several viruses by inhibiting tryptophanase, the enzyme necessary for tryptophan synthesis. Further, tryptophanase may activate the stop codon of Ebola, UGA, thus stopping protein translation of Ebola. Consequently, an easier neutralization of the deadly virus may be possible.\"If the acid-based coating inhibits tryptophanase AND tryptophanase may activate the viral stop codon...how will inhibiting this enzyme allow it to also activate (if that is what it does) the viral stop codon (and thus neutralize the virus)? It would seem that these two processes are opposed to each other, or am I missing something?How does the coating (its constituent chemical) get past the virus glyco protein  shell so as to inhibit (switch off) the gene that codes for tryptophanase? thanks, M. R.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThank you for your comments. The high concentration of salt destroys the capsid, due to osmotic stress releasing Ebola RNA. Further 3 methyl antranilic  acid inhibits tryptophanase. This is an enzyme which reversible hydrolyses tryptophan to indole, pyruvate and ammonia. It was shown in the literature that expression of tryptophanase induced elevated levels of tryptophan http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8501042. Further Tryptophan induction prevents Rho factor-dependent termination of protein translation. In another words tryptophan deficiency may accelerate the stop codon, thus stopping the protein translation and finally protein synthesis. I also will upload an article about osmotic stress and the releasing of nucleic acids from virus capsids.\n    "
