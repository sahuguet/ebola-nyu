  "summary": "I would fit the hazmat suits with an extra layer of plastic over the zipper area and around the face that would be attached with Velcro and could be removed with a ripcord.  Also change inside zipper to Velcro that undoes as part of extra layer removal. Then layer of plastic most likely to touch skin as suit comes off will be clean.  I would change procedure for removing gloves to inside out method described below.",
