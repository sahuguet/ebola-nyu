I think this could significantly help the outbreak by slowing down the spread of the virus.\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Sanitary Stations should be built in each village to help contain the Ebola virus.If someone is showing beginning symptoms of Ebola in a village, they can isolate them in a Sanitary Station (people contacted and people suspected to be infected will be separated). Here, health workers can maintain sanitary conditions and care for people; this way, proper disposal of bodily fluids (vomit, etc.) can be ensured instead of putting family members at risk by making them dispose of the fluids. The people with symptoms or people contacted would stay there until they could be taken to the hospital for further treatment.",
