Even if the UV light kills the viral particles, the test only looks for the proteins that are released by the virus when its inside of a host cell. So even if the virus dies, the proteins which they left behind can be tagged with the QD's.\n    "

Several bio-imaging applications for QD currently exist, for instance, QD's have been used to detect the progression of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). QD synthesis and protien-conjugation is\u00a0inexpensive and simple.QD's would be covered in a polymer shell with embedded protiens which will target and bind to the glycoproteins that are secreted by cells infected with the virus. Testing would be short and involve the collection a small blood sample that would be exposed it to the QD solution. If the sample retains QD's, it will glow when exposed to UV/IR light,\u00a0 and indicate the presence of an Ebola infection. With enough support and resources, we can deploy testing kits at a fairly low cost and provide a more reliable test (as opposed to testing for a fever).\n        </div>",
