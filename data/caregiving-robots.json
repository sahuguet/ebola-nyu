Or is there any material that the robots are made of that can be washed easily and not getting it damaged?\n    "

You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "Given the massive amount of health professionals needed, risk and the probably long period they will be needed it would be prime-time to boost manufacture of caregiving robots. They can certainly take on several easy, or even more complicated, tasks. Off course it must be robust enough to disinfect.I don\u00b4t think they will be felt as much more alien than people in PPE:s. Not the most innovative idea and probably regarded as inhumane but given the circumstances....",
