You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

Given the wide adoption of mobile phones, we'd like to use this network to create a trusted, accurate and bi-directional source of health care related information that every mobile users can access for free.  We'll partner with local carriers such as Orange, CellCom, MTN/Areeba, etc. to enable us to reach all of their users with a live voice call.  Culturally a phone call is regarded as prestigious and we'd to leverage this fact. Once locals have received a call, they will be able to speak live with a health educator in a local language. Educators could be in any country following a script, gathering data, answering questions and debunking myths.",
