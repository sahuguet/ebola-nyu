  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            The idea of making the infected fluids more visually distinct grows from the observation that some pills I have taken in the past made my urine change color to greenish. \u00a0 What if individuals who are confirmed Ebola-positive could be given a pill that will color all of their clear bodily fluids in a predictble way? \u00a0I would pull together a small group of experts and, assuming there was a choice of colorant, select a color for marking infected fluids that is culturally associated with danger or threat in West Africa. \u00a0 Then I would have medical experts and some traditional healers brainstorm on selecting an orally-administerable substance known to act as the desired colorant. \u00a0Then I would mount a PSA campaign showing what the infected fluids look like, on bedding, on hazmat suits, on a linen-wrapped corpse, etc.\n        </div>",
