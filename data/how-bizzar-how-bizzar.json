      "message": "\n    \tI wonder if that would work...  it might.  And a corollary would be -- for feet that might sweat -- put a pantiliner in the boot soles to soak up foot sweat...  seriously.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also wondering what could be done so care workers don't have to go to the bathroom so often, having to take off their suits and go through protocol each time -- what, besides starving themselves, could make them take care of business without having to don and take off their suits every time?  So they can stay working four to six hours straight?  The less often they have to don and take off their suits of PPE, the less chance of cross-contamination.\n    "

(These would not be vented, as venting is a no-no!!)The SolutionThe tampon goggles have an extra container and holder to hold a tampon, they not only are designed to hold a shit load of moisture but also a hermetically sealed!I am not seeking any financial reward for this!",
