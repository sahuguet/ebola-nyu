These systems can be leveraged for field deployments worldwide.\n    "

In terms of network (contagion, contact) tracking or tracing,  I think that it could/might work well with my concept, detailed here:https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/using-social-metric-sm-badges-to-monitor-potential-exposure-and-expedite-contact-tracing-amongst-healthcare-providersPlease consider joining my team or inviting me to join yours\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tM. Ricciardi, thanks for the outreach.  Enterprise-ready badges for healthcare definitely exist with applications and network infrastructure.  There are several large players in the market that support top tier hospitals as well as field deployments.  I think with the present situation, more rudimentary technology is required now, then other technologies can be applied a bit later, as the infrastructure and healthcare systems on the ground in Africa take shape over the longer term.  Very much appreciated!\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tAgreed. That is one reason why I chose to focus mainly on contact tracking amongst healthcare workers via SM badges, which, compared to hand held computers, are far more \"rudimentary\" and do not depend on any pre-existing infrastructure (with the exception of a central database/server/analytics program).  But it would seem that, in terms of collecting field data (where a HW could come into contact with an infected person), the integration of SM badges with your \"point of care\" data collection (for tracking and monitoring amongst a larger population*) would seem to be  way of covering both sides of the contagion equation, if you will.* The size/scope/scale of this population is of course limited by the number of people actually contacted/examined (but data from this could be 'scaled up' or extrapolated to the wider population to give predictive models some initial inputs.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHealthcare badges have already been deployed in larger scale in-hospitals today.  We've been working with sensor experts to really understand additional requirements in badges for other types of things.  I personally believe sensing technology will take off in the next few years, but progress will be slow as the supply chains just aren't quite there yet for volume production, and we still don't really understand the complexities of wearable technologies as it relates to humans (we're very complicated beings).  As an aside, we've been looking into the rudimentary ways of sensing - tapes, pins, meters and such - that may be easier to deploy in the nearer term in the field.  We've recently been brainstorming along those lines, as well.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tQuestion: regarding your statement: \"Healthcare badges have already been deployed in larger scale in-hospitals today.\" Do you know for what purposes these badges were used? (contact t tracing?) It would seem that contact (on-site/workplace) tracing (in the context of contagion monitoring) would be the simplest application of this tech. A basic RF transceiver, battery (Li+) and storage chip would seem to be all that is needed (+ the searchable computer program to upload/compile/aggregate the contact data)...and should be mass- producible or at least producible on the scale of hundreds (for a given clinic).As for you other statement: \"we still don't really understand the complexities of wearable technologies as it relates to humans (we're very complicated beings)\" Agreed. The MIT-based Human Dynamics group (http://hd.media.mit.edu/) is all about this. But I would add, many other researchers (e.g., clinical psychologists, sociologists) have been using SM badges (for simple contact mapping; some using cameras) for several years now. The sensing tech used in SM badges is well-known/studied (and widely used), and, they require little if any manual interactivity from the wearer (wear it and forget about it).\n    "
