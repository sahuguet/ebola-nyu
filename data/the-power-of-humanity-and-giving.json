  "summary": "The treatment of Ebola through the means of Convalescent serum, or the transfusion of blood from a patient who survived Ebola to one currently with it, is the logical solution to a very threatening problem.  If one who is willing to give blood, which contains some of the anti-bodies that were used to fight ebola, then they should test this on patients who are likely to die whether they receive the blood or not.    Many worry however that through the blood transfusions, a person could also be receiving HIV, but that is a risk I would be willing to take if I already had a 50-90% chance of dying.  We need to unite, and find community and humanity to survive this struggle. With multiple success stories in the past, its logical to continue.",
