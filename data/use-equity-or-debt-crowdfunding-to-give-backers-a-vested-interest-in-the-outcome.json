      "message": "\n    \tHi Sherwood, great insights. Funding is always crucial to the impact that a solution can have. How might we engage both established organizations and individuals to be part of funding the solution i.e smaller contributions coupled with large contributions? Perhaps you could share more around the crowd funding model for health care issues specifically? There's many crowd funding platforms out there including one specifically for health called http://www.medstartr.com. What other platforms do you think we could use?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Deborah ... thanks.  Here are my thoughts: 1) Establish a matching fund to engage both the crowd and more established organizations.  If organizations only care about donating then 2) have a parallel fund where they match the funds in the form of a grant. \"The fund\" would be in charge of making the grants/investments on behalf of the crowd (and would need a team in order to accomplish this). The investments/grants could be made based on crowd input (eg: very much like you are doing this contest). The idea around health care is that there are independent parts (solutions) that could be put together but probably need funding to do so. This could allow that to happen.  Medstartr is a great place to start however it looks only focused on donations crowdfunding, we would need to layer on debt and equity crowdfunding so that means using additional platforms.\n    "

  "summary": "Ideas are great but they are nothing without money. Money solves one part of the problem, funding, but not the other, engagement. Crowdfunding has proven it is possible to engage a community of interest in the solution to a problem with funds. Debt & equity crowdfunding is showing that funds given in the form of an investment turn donors from passively involved to actively engaged. This means they become a marketing engine, help to sell a product/solution, help iterate on an outcome, and/or provide introductions to other key players - all because they have a VESTED interest in the success of their investment. This crisis could benefit from incorporating the crowd for their funds and to engage them as investors rather than donors.",
