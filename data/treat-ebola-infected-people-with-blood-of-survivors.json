That means that if indeed there are antibodies they may be personalized and sometimes work sometimes don't. Are you agree ?\n    "

One survivors blood may be packed with antibodies, while another survivor may not have nearly as many. So if we could test the number of antibodies in someones blood then the blood transfusion method could be a rather strong method in the fight against Ebola.\n    "

Check out \"21 day quarantine.\"  If one did tested positive in the quarantine period then they would still be close in close proximity to a transfusion options.  I, personally, would take a transfusion and hope for the best!\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            My idea is for those who have come down with Ebola already and how we can help cure them. After reading an article of the past outbreaks of Ebola in 1976 and 1995, the idea of using the blood of the survivors of Ebola \u00a0as a cure seems feasible to be put into place now. It was not put into action in 1976 because it was thought of when the outbreak had nearly subsided, but the was used in 1995. It was used on a small scale where eight patients who had been infected by Ebola were treated with the blood that was donated by five people who had survived the Ebola infection. Of the eight patients treated seven of them survived. \u00a0This treatment looks promising but there are some risks too it, the risk of transferring HIV or Hepatitis C. Although there is a risk, this idea is promising and should be put into use becaus it is a feasible treatment that has evidence supporting that it can and could work now to aid in keeping the death toll for Ebola from rising any higher.\n        </div>",
