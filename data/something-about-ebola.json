  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Ebola virus disease can be defined as a disease of humans and other\u00a0primates\u00a0caused by\u00a0ebolaviruses\u00a0(EBOV). Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus as a\u00a0fever,\u00a0sore throat,\u00a0muscle pain\u00a0and\u00a0headaches. Here are some facts about ebola:\n<br/> 1. The first known outbreak of the disease was recorded in 1976. It originated in Zaire (today's Democratic Republic of the Congo). The virus got its name after the Ebola River which is thought to be the place where the first people got infected.\n<br/> 2. The ebola virus is not as contagious as it is fatal.\n<br/> 3. The ebola virus is not airborne and can only be contracted through contact of the subject's bodily fluids, objects that have been contaminated, or contact with the subject itself.\n<br/> 4. Studies have shown that the fruit bat is the most probable host of the ebola virus.\n<br/> 5. If someone is to survive the effects of the ebola virus and recover from it, they are immune to the virus and cannot transmit it to others.\n<br/> 6. Currently, Liberia has the most cases of ebola coming in at a whopping 3,834 cases and from those 2,069 deaths.\n<br/> 7. Vaccines are being developed and speculations rise that a cure is on the way.\n<br/>\n<br/> Here are some treatment for ebola virus:\n<br/> 1. Standard support:\n<br/> No specific treatment is currently approved. However, survival is improved by early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment. Treatment is primarily\u00a0supportive\u00a0in nature. These measures may include\u00a0management of pain,\u00a0nausea,\u00a0fever\u00a0and\u00a0anxiety, as well as rehydration via the\u00a0oral\u00a0or by\u00a0intravenous\u00a0route.\n<br/>\n<br/> 2. Intensive care:\n<br/> Intensive care\u00a0is often used in the developed world. This may include maintaining blood volume and electrolytes (salts) balance as well as treating any bacterial infections that may develop.\n<br/>\n<br/> 3. Alternative medicine:\n<br/> The\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0(FDA) advises people to be careful of advertisements making unverified or fraudulent claims of benefits supposedly gained from various anti-Ebola products. The FDA has already sent out at least one letter of warning to a seller of\u00a0colloidal silver\u00a0who made unverified claims of Ebola related benefits, supposedly derived from the use of their products.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
