  "summary": "Getting information about the disease to the local community in Sierra Leone and Iberia is still a problem. Health staff is confronted by violence and misunderstanding. Residents even think that western health workers bring the virus.A song by popular local Musicians could raise awareness, about the cause of the disease and what precautions should be made. If this song becomes a hit, everyone will hear it and learn about Ebola.This should be a corporation, of talented local songwriters, radio stations and music idols.",
