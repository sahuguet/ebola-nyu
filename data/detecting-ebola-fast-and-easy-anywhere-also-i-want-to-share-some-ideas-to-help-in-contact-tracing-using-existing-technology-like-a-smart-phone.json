It will also tell scientists more about the disease ,like how long it stays on surfaces and to pinpoint the breeches in PPE protection. This will also help stop the spread of infection among the public. 3. The smart phone can be used in this fight. We need to recycle smart phones and give them to less developed countries to make this work. We can use these phones to track people through the GPS. We can also use the front facing cameras and use apps like Skype ,to have doctor visits without physical contact and give doctors protection against misdiagnosis during this method, this will also save a lot of money and time for everyone. You can also take these ideas and apply new ideas on top of them.\n        </div>",

The smart phone will be a valuable technology for those who have one, with contact tracing,home quarantine to monitor for people who may have had exposure and possible at home doctor visits through Skype.",
