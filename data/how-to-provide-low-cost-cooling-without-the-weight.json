      "message": "\n    \tTo me this sounds good in principal NV.  Let's see how ideo's process unfolds - to me it is very unclear if and how things get funded by Ideo/USAid.  Are they looking to fund proposals or building a platform for volunteers to find each other?  The USAID links leading me hear suggested that $5 million dollars was available to get going on this highly important intiative.  On this openideo site, however, there is no talk of funding.  They've built a very exciting, lively platform, but have left some of us clueless about what the next steps are?  Is there any money at all for development or should we be thinking about spending evenings in the garage and home depot?  Perhaps I'm just not smart enough to figure what's an obvious process for everyone else?  What's your understanding of teams and funding?\n    "

I think that the shirt with the woven pneumatic tubing in it could easily be mass produced for the aid workers.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHey Jab,Nice addition! I was building more on the idea today and I had a similar concept, I had already incorporated a hollow inside the static part of the carrying ball for the washer pump and ice, maybe the removable part could be just like a small insulated cooler with a couple spouts on the bottom to provide an access point for the circulation tubes to attach to?  That way, when the ice needs to be refilled, you could just pull out the \"cooler\", pour out the water, fill it back up with ice, and then attach it back into the system! It seems pretty simple, but we will definitely have to make some models first to test out the concepts, thanks for the contribution, you are more than welcome to join the team if you are feeling up to it!\n    "
