  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            By connecting remote communities to a central communication hub via satelitte phones we could pass on test results faster, educate people around how the disease is spread when an infection has been identified, and make availible teams that will come to their homes to treat them. \u00a0\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> It seems that containment is the fastest way to stop the epidemic, and caring for the sick is the fastest way it is spread. Maybe - \u00a0by being able to 'order' health teams that will come to you with care kits, people will stay put if they are infected, then perhaps we can contain the spread.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> And in the process, create a communications infrastructure where there wasn't one!\u00a0\n        </div>",
