  "summary": "Many accounts of Ebola epidemic draw contrast between intentions and implementation. Some of the measures implemented on the ground\u2014 quarantines, space-suite PPE, etc\u2014 can be viewed as hegemonic. One particular area that could be addressed is in the case of measuring temperatures.Measuring temperatures plays a vital role in controlling the spread of the disease. However, the off-the-shelf tool being used is a Pyrometer gun whose form only serves to provide a convenient grip, but does not affect the function of the sensor or the readings. Many view these guns as weapons, representing a manifestation of political or social discord. An alternative form could ameliorate this perception.",
