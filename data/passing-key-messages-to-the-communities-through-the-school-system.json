Avoid direct contact with blood, saliva, vomit, urine and other bodily fluids of people with\u00a0EVD\u00a0or unknown illnesses. \n<ul>\n<li>Avoid direct contact with bodies of people who died of\u00a0EVD\u00a0or unknown illnesses.</li>\n<li>Avoid contact with any medical equipment, such as needles, contaminated with blood or bodily fluids.</li>\n<li>If you are a health care worker, practice strict infection control measures. This includes isolating infected individuals and properly using personal protective equipment (gowns, masks, goggles and gloves).</li>\n<li>If you are a health care worker, properly use and disinfect instruments and equipment used to treat or care for patients with Ebola - like needles and thermometers - before throwing them out.</li>\n</ul> 2. Avoid close contact with wild animals and avoid handling wild meat.\n<br/>\n<br/> Avoid potential carriers, both live and dead, since both can spread the virus. Potential carriers of the virus include: \n<ul>\n<li>chimpanzees</li>\n<li>gorillas</li>\n<li>monkeys</li>\n<li>forest antelope</li>\n<li>pigs</li>\n<li>porcupines, and</li>\n<li>fruit bats</li>\n</ul>\n<br/> 3. Know the symptoms of\u00a0EVD\u00a0and see a health care provider if they develop. \n<ul>\n<li>Closely monitor your health during and after travel. Seek medical attention immediately if a fever and any other symptoms arise during or after travel.</li>\n<li>If you develop symptoms, be sure to tell your health care provider that you have travelled to a region where\u00a0EVD\u00a0was present.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

  "summary": "The key to stopping the spread of Ebola is through educating people on preventative actions. This can be achieved through an already established education system. Other than incorporating this into the school curriculum, a fact sheet with critical information could be sent home with students to be shared with parents and others in their communities. This material would compliment information that is passed through other media channels, hopefully reinforcing the message to raise awareness and thus contain the spread of Ebola.",
