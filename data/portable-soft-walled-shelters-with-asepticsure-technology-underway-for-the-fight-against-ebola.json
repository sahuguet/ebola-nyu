Just out of curiosity - what is your turn around time for production and are they designed for rapid and low-cost distribution to remote areas? Is there any way that the OpenIDEO community can help you develop the idea or get it into communities faster? Feel free to update your post with needs/questions :)\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHello Deborah - What we know for sure is that the system works.  It was designed as a lightweight rapidly deployable kit and we have lots of experience with our portable shelters worldwide.  We know they work in any type of climate.  We also know that AsepticSure works and effectively cleans the shelters and equipment left inside as demonstrated on September 18th.  Design Shelter has designed a series of smaller remote village kits that are intended to be deployed to the source of the virus and to help quarantine and treat patients professionally without them having to migrate into the cities and spreading their illness. I would not say they were low cost but would say that they are cost effective based on impact they could have in helping slow down and eradicate Ebola.  Of course we welcome community ideas on how we might find a mandate to utilize this technology in the field.  Production capacity depends on our order book but generally speaking we can be prepared to ship turn key kits in 30 to 60 days.  We appreciate being part of this community and hopefully collectively we can figure out how to place Design Shelter Q kits into the field.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThere is zero impact to the environment. Ozone is generated temporarily to kill the virus as part of the disinfection process and is contained inside the near air tight shelter.  The ozone is then rapidly destructed to create pure oxygen. The beauty of this solution is that it it 100% reusable.  Once one of the shelters in the complex is disinfected, you move to the next shelter on a rotational basis.  This technology thoroughly cleans to 6 logs all contamination left inside the portable shelter including the shelter itself and on any medical equipment left inside. AsepticSure allows for complete cleaning and disinfection so that you minimize the exposure of Ebola virus to patients, nurses and doctors working within the facility.  Thy clients maximize their investment by not having to incinerate or dispose of their field hospital. AsepticSure technology has been thoroughly tested against all materials that comprise the Design Shelter kit and it has been proven that no degradation in materials exists with repeated exposures to high concentration ozone gas.Price on a per field hospital basis runs between US$300k and US$500k as shown in the layout drawings depending on options which allows for the treatment of up to 50 patients with the option to expand by 30 patient modules.Clients would traditionally be both government and non-government organizations including charitable foundations, remote health service delivery groups and philanthropists to name a few.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            I have worked with Brad over the past few years developing portable hospitals for use in South Sudan. His company is one of the most innovative on the planet and from the following letter I received on Sept, 3, 2014, he was well on his way in rapid prototyping and development.\n<br/>\n<br/> I just received his latest update 10/8/2014.\n<br/>\n<br/> Attached and below is the latest information on what we have available related to Ebola.\u00a0 The configuration attached was created from the consensus of 5 infectious disease experts and this recommended Ebola field hospital is configured as a 40-50 bed field hospital with expansion in 30 bed lots. You will notice one drawing showing arrows \u2013 green is for two way traffic and red is one way traffic.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> Most of the kit we can deliver but some of it is better received by the client.\u00a0 Unfortunately this is not an \u201cavailable and ready to ship\u201d scenario, rather we will need to begin the manufacturing process with any firm orders.\u00a0 That said we have the ability to ramp up rather quickly.\n<br/>\n<br/> We have pilot program with Queens University in Kingston along with our partner Medizone (www.medizone.com) where we plan to demonstrate effective 6 log decontamination of Corona virus inside our structures in a remote setting.\u00a0 Corona virus is more virulent but similar to Ebola in structure.\u00a0 Effectively eradicating Corona virus inside our shelters will prove that Ebola can also be eradicated.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> The solution will comprise our portable soft walled shelters and the AsepticSure technology which will show that our shelters can be used as temporary and fully portable treatment and quarantine facilities for Ebola victims.\u00a0 Once the patient has exited the shelter then the AsepticSure technology will completely clean and eradicate the virus in 90 to 120 minutes making the facility usable for the next patient. The real benefit of this solution is that it can be taken to the remote villages and effectively utilized to lower the spread of the virus.\u00a0 Treating patients in the field will prevent them from migrating to the larger cities where the majority of hospitals are not prepared.\u00a0 This solution is also scalable to create extra treatment and quarantine capacity as required.\n<br/>\n<br/> We are close to introducing to the market.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> Regards,\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> Brad Matchung, P.Eng.,\n<br/> President\n<br/> Unit 35, 1545 Britannia Road East\n<br/> Mississauga, ON\u00a0 L4W 3C6\n<br/> Canada\n<br/> T: 604-921-8805\n<br/> C: 778-558-2172\n<br/> www.designshelter.com\n        </div>",
