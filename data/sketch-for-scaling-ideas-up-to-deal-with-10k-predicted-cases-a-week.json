You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            A) For new drugs:\u00a0re-Look at all traditional medicines to check out anti-viral properties (one old article here: http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/a-folk-remedy-for-killer-ebola/148114.article ) ; (Medical-) anthropologists could interview worldwide traditions to this effect (Tibetan medicine (yartsa?), Chinese, African, Native cultures of the Americas, folk remedies everywhere. Also interviews should be done on folk treatment of symptoms. Historians should also re-check old texts for ideas on treatments.\n<br/>\n<br/> B) Treatment Centers should be raised up a floor so disposal of gear &amp; contaminated waste can be done easily by falling through large chutes into tubs/recipients in an incinerator/disinfecting area below on the ground floor with easy truck access if needed to bury (ashes) elsewhere.\n<br/> Zones with see-through hard plastic walls with impermeable glove \"sockets\" can allow for coaching sessions or even family \"visits\" by maintaining a non-contaminated zone next to a contaminated one.\n<br/> As much as possible, building materials of hospital surfaces should have antiseptics incorporated into them (much like fireproofing chemicals are put in building materials). \u00a0\n<br/> Incorporate \"old fashioned\" techniques which can prove superior to \"modern\" equipment as here with hospital ventilation: http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040068\n<br/>\n<br/> C) re-used mattresses (of antiseptic materials?) could be bleached &amp; put in waterproof plastic pouches for each use. (Rolls of?) disposable bedding made of \"diaper\"-style layers--absorbable one side &amp; plastified on the other--with a towel incorporated for preliminary cleaning when taking off sheet. (Nurses, nurse aids &amp; midwives should be consulted on how to best make these designs.)\n<br/>\n<br/> D) Frontline Health Care Workers will need the support they deserve with a calm, clean place to unwind &amp; discuss experiences/give feedback to team of psychologists/coaches/religious figures/prayer space there when needed--also stretching/exercise to combat fatigue of repetitive movements &amp; heavy lifting. Check out integrating mid-wives into ebola care as their training &amp; skills can be efficiently crossed-over to this situation.\n<br/>\n<br/> E) Regional Strategies on things such as disinfecting homes/neighborhoods, and travel restrictions, providing UV light tunnels to kill the virus on the recent contacts of the ill (?);\n<br/> Temporary triage/welcome centers with clear contaminated/potentially contaminated/non-contaminated zones should be set up in villages for information and for first-step isolation of patients needing testing before going to a large-scale treatment center. Governments, along with religious figures &amp; anthropologists could work on adapting funeral rites &amp; inventing new ones to avoid contamination while respecting the greiving process. They would need to communicate this clearly in a comforting way to create understanding among the affected population.\n        </div>",
