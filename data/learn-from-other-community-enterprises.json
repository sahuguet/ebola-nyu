  "summary": "Far-reaching, efficient distribution of education is essential, but in a rural setting this is difficult. The most efficient solution is to tap into pre-existing channels, especially those where many networks come together in one place (hubs), and use them to reinforce themselves: an example of this is rice-farm co-operatives in Asia, where a central point is visited by many farmers, from many rural communities. Establishing parallels to these hubs (marketplaces, administrative centres etc), and providing education to the representatives of the various communities there would increase the information transfer to difficult to reach areas, decrease the strain on resource and engage local people in the solution.",
