You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "I'm wondering if the family members of Mr. Duncan (in Dallas) have been tested to see if they have antibodies to Ebola.  If so, it would indicate either that they have some prior immunity (natural or acquired), OR that limited exposure to an ebola patient prior to the patient's most acute (and contagious) stage could be enough to stimulate the development of immunity in the family/caretakers.  It might be akin to the immunity from the minute exposure of a live vaccination.",
