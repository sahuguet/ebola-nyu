      "message": "\n    \tI'd like to see a 21 day quarantine at the epicenter so that we wouldn't have to transfer resources to other --  random -- places like a cruise ship in Belize.  Look at how much money has been spent on containing the outfall from one random traveler to the US.  Some people feel like this would be leaving these three countries to their own means.  I believe it would help the world focus our attention on the countries that are completely overwhelmed.   How could your services help solve problems that would be isolated to these three countries in the epicenter?   Thank you in advance. Very nice post.\n    "
