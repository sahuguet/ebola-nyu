It's so easy to focus on the potential epidemic and fear versus the needs of those who are helping to end the epidemic and on the stories of survival. GRATITUDE can be so powerful/moving.This brings to mind the question :How can survivors be best equipped to become empowered activists in demystifying and helping to treat Ebola in their communities ?\n    "

Would you mind applauding or \"adding this idea\" to my post because I can't think of a better way to celebrate those who would be willing to spend three weeks in quarantine before travel, in an effort to SAVE THE WORLD from this epidemic.

There has been  discussion about the role of community leaders in educating citizens and combating myths and stigma.   Perhaps  leaders from rural and urban communities can participate and moderate a discussion with members of their community on the radio as an example.Can storytelling be used also to capture memories of loved ones that have died?  Is there a way to start  local archives of stories, memories, narratives about loved ones that were lost?  sort of a collective memorial?  I do not know what the culture is regarding remembering and honoring loved ones that have passed in these communities and sharing these memories.  Does anyone here?  It seems that the loss here is deeply personal but also a loss of community.\n    "

The stories are collected in a studio on a bus that travels around the US and stays in a community for a period of time so people can come in to share their stories.  It is really an amazing project.  How about a project like this to collect stories in the effected communities?  Any story.  Survivor stories, stories told by family members about their loved ones, stories told by family members so that younger children can remember lost parents, stories told by health workers - anyone who wants to participate.  Stories can be archived but since they will recorded it can be a good way to share stories, particularly the survivor stories, with local radio stations. http://storycorps.org/\n    "

It may be helpful for the project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ib6WbIKyRESome points that I liked from the video:-(25:27) Laurence Sailly, emergency coordinator MSF, mentions that they had 211 survivors out of 706 confirmed and admitted Ebola cases. This means a 29.8% survival rate (or as mentioned in the video about 30%)-Around minute 28:14 you'll find a couple of survivors' testimonials (how they got there, the treatment they received, what would their message be about Ebola).-From all the testimonials, I found Salome Karwa's very informative (38:34): :: \"The virus Ebola is deadly, but if you survive the virus Ebloa, they should be accepted in the community... (people) are forgetting that, the virus, if you get it once, you never encounter it again in your life. You can get another sickness, the fever, a different sickness, but you never get Ebola.\"::\"In my community some people said I was still sick, but people that are educated, people that know... that Ebola survivors are not people that can give Ebola again, they always came into our area.\"::\"(MSF personnel) don't just come and leave the food for you, they encourage you to eat. Sometimes they wear a PPE, come in and help us to eat. They give us medication any time you require them... They talk to us, they're not afraid of us. Of course they can encounter the virus, so they wear a PPE, they come to us, they touch us. When some people are falling or vomiting, they help us by carrying to the toilet, to make it to the bathroom. They wipe us... They can bathe you, they sponge bathe you. If you need clothes, they bring clothes... So, their encouragement sometimes helps people, because they take care of you just like a real family member... If you are not encouraged, you are not going to feel fine.\":: \"I can help as many people, just by surviving Ebola. I'm very happy to encourage them and give them my experience, and help them for them to survive.\"Also, I noticed that MSF has a psychological support area for their health care personnel. Just thought if it would be feasible to build an online support community for the people who are taking care of Ebola patients? A place where they can log in and talk with people around the world when they feel the need to and also receive words of encouragement and appreciation?\n    "
