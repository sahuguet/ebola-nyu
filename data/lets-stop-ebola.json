  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Ebola is back, meaning it's occurred before and they found a cure for it in previous years. the World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0thinks that by using the same process that they used for previous outbreaks which is doing blood transfusions from survivors of Ebola to the victims, that\u00a0they can cure the virus because the people who had\u00a0survived, had developed antibodies to fight the virus. However, they are worried about spreading others diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis C. Because so many people are dying we should either begin taking the blood and testing it for diseases before use or try to reconstruct the antibody so that we an inject into the patients. More than 1,145 people have died during this outbreak and over 2,000 have been infected. That makes this the largest outbreak yet. We need to gain control of this outbreak ASAP.\n        </div>",
