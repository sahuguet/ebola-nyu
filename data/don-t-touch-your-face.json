Maybe a company that produces watches, fit bits, etc could embed the motion sensor/vibration technology in a special edition of their products. Wonder what the cost of that would be...\n    "

For instance putting bands in the cloth which cause an resistance if the hands are raised. This may be much easier and faster be made in the countries themself\n    "

It also addresses one of the key components of infectious disease prevention: washing your hands. If recipients use the device to its potential it also significantly reduces the chance of infection given it leaves very few options left for transmission via a mucous membrane.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> The remaining membranes that would not be addressed are the: anus, urethra. However with gentle reminders to wash ones hands semi frequently, that should be a minor issue as well given the availability of sanitizer or water and soap.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Ebola is mainly spread through contact with a mucous membrane. For those of you that don't know, most of those reside on your face: eyes, nose, mouth. Clean hands and not touching ones face are significant measures to reduce the risk of catching ebola. My idea is for healthcare workers AND civilians. It is an electronic wristband or ring with a gyroscope and vibration mechanism. When it senses you lifting your hand to face level it will vigorously vibrate to remind you not to touch. Every hour or so it would also vibrate to remind you to sanitize your hands. I'd also like to direct everyone to this article about self decontaminating clothing. If possible the wrist piece could be sprayed with the material so it is always sterile.",
