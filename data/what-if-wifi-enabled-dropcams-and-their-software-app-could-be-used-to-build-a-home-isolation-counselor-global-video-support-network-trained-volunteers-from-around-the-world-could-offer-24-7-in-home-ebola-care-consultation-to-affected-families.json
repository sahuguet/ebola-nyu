Second set of trained eyes for putting on, removing, and disposing of/disinfecting PPE gear.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> 2. Advice on basic medicines and medical care.\n<br/>\n<br/> 3. To alert the network/community to a change in symptoms or of a mortality\n<br/>\n<br/> 4. To ask for help/advice on infected waste management and/or disposal\n<br/>\n<br/> 5. What else?\n<br/>\n<br/> This could be a pared down basic version of telemedicine. It would require some solid training infrastructure that could be instituted in hospitals and medical schools where professionals and experienced students already have the foundation of knowledge necessary to advise basic treatment and could also be quickly trained on PPE procedures.\n<br/>\n<br/> Do not know if reliable wifi is avialiable in effected areas but if not is there an existing intiative from a non or for profit group that could quickly set up wifi infrastructure in the areas where the most homes are being effected ?\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
