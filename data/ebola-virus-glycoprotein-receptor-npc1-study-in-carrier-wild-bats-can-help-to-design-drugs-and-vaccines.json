You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "It's surprising to know that the wild bat which works as a carrier to Ebola virus remains itself immune to the infection. It's well known now that a cholesterol transporter on cell membrane and organelles (NPC1) binds to virus envelope glycoprotein which is an essential step for infection. It's quite possible that virus entry site on NPC1 in wild bats could have gone some adaptive structural change that prevents infection. Studying the structure of NPC1 in wild bats and related genomic study can help designing drugs and vaccines that prevent  Ebola infection.",
