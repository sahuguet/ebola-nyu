      "message": "\n    \tInventive but lets go with the scenario that these gloves and the invisible garment you are wearing have all been exposed up to your shoulders.  You use your right hand to take off your left glove no problem but then you contaminate your left hand as soon as you touch the tab.I can see however that it would make it easier to grab in this scenario.... You use your right hand to partially remove the glove on your left hand, but while the glove is still on your fingers and partially turned inside out, you use the left partially gloved hand to pull the tab on the right hand turning it inside out.  This leaves the inside of the gloves that can be touched ok with an ungloved hand.The other thing to think of is I've seen the suggestion not to use tape on the palm side because it gets in the way and is easily contaminated.I think we might be able to make a case for it.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tGreat insights Jab :) The thinking behind this was the duct tape tabs would only be used on the internal set of gloves versus external but even in that case what you are pointing out could be an issue.....dohposted a second clip may help better visualize the idea and a sketch, totally open to builds on this idea and other tangential ideas/inspirations...would be happy to act as an illustrator for thoughts you might have\u00a0\u00a0can I make you a team member on this post ? new to OpenIdeo not sue how the flow goesthank again and cheers\n    "
