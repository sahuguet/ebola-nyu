      "message": "\n    \tI added this comment to a question on another idea but thought it might be helpful here as well. A large awareness campaign needs to be carried regarding both of the facts that you mention or the virus will never be contained. Do you have any stats on breastfeeding in the effected countries? Is it clear for how long the virus remains in breast milk?Perhaps a Use Condoms campaign needs to be initiated? Lynn what type of HIV prevention campaigns do they have in these countries? Might need to piggyback onto those messages re: using condoms?Bettina, good questions, WHO estimates anywhere up to 90 days..some less so not enough data but enough to say that it is in the breast milk. You can find all of these stats (http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/) For Sierra Leone: Early initiation of breastfeeding (%), 2008-2012*44.6%Exclusive breastfeeding <6 months (%), 2008-2012*\u00a031.6%\u00a0But please see the following guidance: http://www.ennonline.net/operationalguidanceiycfv2.1 Formula is RARELY a good idea in these countries and it is UNICEF who should be involved in this so women who need supplemental feeding or even wet nurses can be followed. Bringing formula into a country that needs to breastfeed is deadly and not done. With one exception (Iraq) where breastfeeding rates were low. However, it was decided to leave the formula in the maternity supplemental feeding baskets because the women bartered or sold the formula for money (long story). \u00a0All of these countries have PEPFAR (http://www.pepfar.gov/countries/bilateral/) programs and funds; messages could be changed/modified.\n    "

Combining efforts will unite people on all sides to put down these ROOT problems exacerbating the spread of sickness. Great point of focus, that will solve a multitude of other problems if we address THIS one! Thanks!\n    "
