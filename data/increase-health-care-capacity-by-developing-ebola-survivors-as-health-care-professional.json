Perhaps lessons learned from HIV prevention - as well as malaria and other diseases - can inspire insights about how to prototype an \"Ebola corps\", engaging non-health actors and emphasizing on early prevention, as Ebola treatment require specializations costly for developing countries and takes time of training as Seema posted on other comment.What to learn from HIV:http://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-can-donors-learn-hiv-responding-ebolaEbola is not a failure of aid governance:http://www.cgdev.org/blog/letter-liberia-ebola-not-failure-aid-or-governance\n"

WHO for the technical muscle and Ministrys of health to develop a needs assessment and develop training workshops  suited for each level and each country. There would be a central coordinator/body to oversee the process.. Once Ebola has been contained depending on the success and acceptance this could be up scaled to build an infrastructures for health systems.. Doctors and nurses take a lot of traing and time .. So we could have these community health worker force and then work it up to build capacity to staff the Heath systems.. This is just the working model in my head.. I will read up some more and design a flow chart also a skeleton framework of the job discrptions and job specification for the tranee and trainers\n    "

I will think up an organgram and some training workshops. But I strongly feel we need to work from the ground up. My experience had been that the answer lies in the problem.. So any framework we do develop should be very flexible so it can be adjusted to ground realities\n    "

A framework can be developed as to what level of education/training is required for each background and for each poistion. There is no treatment and many of the task done are supportive and do not require any special skill. ebola survivors can be used in screening, looking after the less severe cases thereby reducing the load for the trained nurses and doctors to work where I/V fluids ect are required.\n<br/> If the community/ Health ministry is willing these survivors can be incorporated into mainsteam Health system after the Eloba outbreak is contained\n        </div>",

  "summary": "My idea is train the Ebola survivors to work as Health care personnel. their immunity will keep them safe without protective clothing which is a big Plus in the warm and humid environment. Giving the survivors a job/ stipend will help their reintegration into society and boost the economic status of their family/community as the survivor has probably lost Family member. They are from the communities so are more conversant with the language and customs than International staff. If this is continued the survivor can be trained, depending on their educational status, to become a health care professional to work in in the Healthcare system and rebuild the shortage of staff created by healthcare workers lost to Ebola.",
