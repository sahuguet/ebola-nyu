  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            For a brief background on what I'm talking about I should give the following explanation. \u00a0For the past six years I have been an active participant in SCA armored combat. \u00a0For those not familiar with this sport, the SCA attempts to recreate and preserve the western martial arts of medieval europe. \u00a0Our system of combat is requires the use of conventional body armor that is sufficient to protect us from injury to ourselves and to others. \u00a0During my years as a participant I've made a few observations.\n<br/>\n<br/> Heat can kill. \u00a0This is a both a literal truth and a bit of a metaphor. When participating in full contact combat sports it is important realize when you have over exerted yourself, but the size, weight, and composition of your armor are also very important factors. \u00a0Fabrics that breath are better than those that don't. \u00a0Heavier fabrics may offer more padding, but they also hold in more heat. \u00a0Overheated competitors fatigue more quickly and make more mistakes. \u00a0They put themselves and others at greater risk of injury.\n<br/>\n<br/> Equipment that is does not fit right is a liability. \u00a0More than once I have scrapped useless equipment that bound against my harness or pinched, prodded, or poked me. \u00a0In the beginning my fear of being injured caused me to be overprotective. \u00a0This fear lead to armor that was heavy, bulky, and didn't articulate well. \u00a0This prevented using proper fighting technique as I fought against my armor. \u00a0In fact even when I moved to less restrictive gear I still moved in a way that would prevent painful \"armor bites\" even thought the offending pieces had been removed.\n<br/>\n<br/> Less is more. \u00a0As my skill in combat improved I noticed that I started to scale back on the amount of body my armor covered. \u00a0When I could move freely and confidently unenumbered by the fear of my past I become a much more efficient fighter.\n<br/>\n<br/> Here's the point. \u00a0Ebola is scary. \u00a0There are a variety of health care workers in the field that are facing a deadly foe. \u00a0The natural inclination is to protect yourself as thoroughly as possible. \u00a0I'm not suggesting that health care workers ignore safetry protocols, but here is my idea.\n<br/>\n<br/> Reduce the amount of PPE. \u00a0I know this sounds crazy, but if the isolation suits used by health care workers are a problem then stop using them. \u00a0Instead I propose that we update safety protocols rather than changing PPE. \u00a0For example, daily physical inspections of health care workers should occur at the beginning and end of every day. \u00a0The eyes, ears, nose, and mouth should be examined for foreign or biological material. \u00a0Skin should be examined from the top of head to the bottom of feet for breaks or irritation. \u00a0Discourage the removal of body hair, i.e. daily shaving rituals. \u00a0If PPE is changed the focus should be on efficiency rather making ourselves impervious.\n        </div>",
