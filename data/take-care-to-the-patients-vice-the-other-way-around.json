      "message": "\n    \tDo you have more concrete ideas how this can be done? Staying at home, means, that relatives have to care for the patients.in the famous CDC report who stated the known factor of 2.5 for undereporting \"Estimating the Future Number of Cases in the Ebola Epidemic \u2014 Liberia and Sierra Leone, 2014\u20132015\" http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm?s_cid=su6303a1_wthere is also a value I see less often. The authors assume that:A hospitalized patient infects 0.02 persons a day, as he is averagely 6 days infective, he infects 0.12 persons.A person in effective home or community care infects 0.03 persons a day, makes 0.18 persons. I have no information how reliable this is, but that would mean, that carying for relative at home is not so dangerous as people might think. As long as the persons does it once and careful for a limited time, he has good chances to survive. But this is in the moment a guess, still to be proved\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tIt would seem to me that when a person first starts to exhibit symptoms, their family members are likely to have already been exposed to some degree. Allowing them to provide care, supplied and guided through the process. Agree that waste removal is a challenge. Perhaps chemical waste disposal units be used? For the most part, the idea is to bring the necessities to the patient to avoid transporting the virus and limiting unnecessary contact.\n    "

We'd love to engage more people into developing an idea around how to reduce the amount of transportation for patients. If you need help getting visual check out - http://ideo.pn/vis-uals.\n    "
