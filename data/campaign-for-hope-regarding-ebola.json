  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            One of the big problems with the current Ebola outbreak that I have read about is the lack of a health care infrastructure in West Africa. Hopefully, as other countries contribute aid and resources, this situation will improve. However, it is also important to let populations experiencing Ebola outbreaks know of an improving healthcare situation, in order to grow the trust between citizens and doctors/nurses.\u00a0I\u2019ve seen many articles online about Ebola patients escaping quarantine, as well as other sick people refusing to go to the hospital for fear of catching Ebola. One idea I have to help this situation is to run some kind of campaign in the nations affected by Ebola.\u00a0This campaign could be on billboards, television, etc. and highlight people who have survived Ebola, the doctors that have helped them recover, and even the hospitals that they stayed in. This may give people hope that, if they seek care, recovery is possible. Also, people sick with other diseases may have enough confidence in their infrastructure to seek care without fear of contracting Ebola from the hospital. I realize that an advertising campaign may not seem like the most obvious use of funding in this situation, but better infrastructure won\u2019t do any good if the people in need of it aren\u2019t comfortable with it.\n        </div>",
