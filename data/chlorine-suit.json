Mix a bleach solution about the same as a hot tub or swimming pool.\u00a0 Kids can spend all day in a pool, so can you (If your'e worried about being soaked in chlorine).\u00a0 As far as I know bleach kills ebola virus. \u00a0\n        </div>",

Really simple and inexpensive, cotton socks, long underwear tops and bottoms, head sock (like what painters wear), and very thin cotton glove liners, soaked in water/chlorine solution.  Put it on before everything else and remove last in a decon shower, dispose of in biowaste bag and incinerate, single use only.",
