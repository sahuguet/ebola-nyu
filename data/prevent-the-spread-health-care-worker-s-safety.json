This has occurred through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.\n<br/>\n<br/> The workers need to BE EXTREMLY CAREFUL with gloves, clothing, blood, or any fluids.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Health-care workers should always take extreme precautions when they are directly working with the patients. These includes basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, wearing proper clothing, googles, blocking splashes or other contact with infected materials, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.\n<br/>\n<br/> When in close contact of patients, health-care workers should wear face protection, face shield or a medical mask and goggles. also, put on a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves.\n<br/>\n<br/> Not only the people who are working directly with Ebola patients, but the laboratory workers are also at risk. The samples that are taken from human and animals for investigation of Ebola infection should handled with precaution and extreme care because the virus can easily tramist and spread. It should be handled by professional on this matter of case.\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
