      "message": "\n    \tHi They, i looked a bit further, this are the specifications of a typical PPE clothing: http://www2.dupont.com/Personal_Protection/en_GB/products/tychem/tychem-tychem-c-technical-data.html#fabric They also specify the strength of the material, I would say it is critical that the backpack never exceeds the specified strength of the material.But you made me thinking about cooling part of the PPE. If an area of 0.2 m^2 is cooled with a temperature difference of 10K, the heat flow through the PPE should be in the order of a few hundred Watt. And the temperature would probably be high enough, so that the material does not loose its mechanical properties.But still you have to transport this few hundred Watt from the skin to the cooled area. Here I have only venting and condensing sweat as workable Idea in my mind.With kind regardsRainer\n    "

Well thought out.I have been focusing on perspiration as the distributing medium.In my tests using ice packs, gel packs and multi-layer materials to simulate environment, I've found that the body does a good job of regulating itself under and around the contact point. i.e. when cooler, less sweat, less contact and vice versa.I'm in south Texas, simulating Africa heat has not been a problem. :/\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi They, a dry ice block 1'H X 10\"W X 3~4\"D weights with a density of 1.5g/cm^3 (Sorry for the metric units) about 0.86kg. With a latent heat of sublimation for dry ice of 571 kJ/kg, it can absorb an energy of 491 kJ. If this is done over 10 hours, the heat flow would be 491000 J / 36000 s = 13W. This is far to small to cool a health worker in a protective clothing. He will produce about 100 W of energy at rest, if he is active maybe 300 W or more. So the heat transfer has to be much faster.Further, I doubt whether a person can be effectively cooled over such a small surface. Typical cooling garments cover much greater parts of the body (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Cooling_and_Ventilation_Garment).Interesting is the idea to have something cold on the outside of the PPE, and to transfer the heat energy at this part of the garment to the outside. Supposed it is possible to cool the inside of the PPE under the backpack so efficient, that water condensate easily, this may be one peace of a workable solution. Together with a workable ventilation of the skin, it would make the climate inside the PPE much more pleasant.We should keep in mind, that constructors have to tackle with many details. Some can be seen in advance, others are found only while testing. The material of the PPE may be weeker if it cooled. If a backpack is worn over the PPE, this may cause the material to fail. Even a few ruptures in a PPE while the system is tested, may cause the health care workers to fear using it. ... Even if the problem is now solved.With kind regards,Rainer\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Deborah, good questions. I didn't want to get into too much detail (something I'm prone to do I'm told ;) ) for brevity sake.The reason I chose Dry Ice is it's versatility. It's light-weight for it's mass, long-lasting, requires only reasonable insulation for storage/transport.My understanding is most of the clinics have generators, which could add refrigeration for DI storage. Other more remote locations could be supplied by ground transportation and airdrop.DI is readily available, and straight-forward to produce in mass.The backpacks themselves should be insulated on all exposed sides. You should incorporate a Glycerin-based 'fluid' layer between the DI and the Thermal transfer plate that makes actual contact with the suit. This fluid layer could be a flat series of gel-packs to act as the buffer between the DI and the contact plate.This would be the most efficient.The beauty of this is concept is it doesn't rely on any special technology. All that's needed is some stock backpacks, modified to accommodate the new objective.This again, is a very low-cost, rapidly deployable means to cool these suits.I project that a 1'H X 10\"W X 3~4\"D DI block will provide cooling for 8~12 hours.(Note: A \"variable\" estimate, having done only preliminary study of materials and anticipated climate environment.) If you would like intricate design details, and how to implement them in the field, I can provide that information.In addition, if I can be of any personal assistance with this project, I would be pleased to help.Lastly, I would point out the obvious -- a lot of people are in trouble right now...they're fighting for their lives. Their fighting for OUR lives. And we can help.We need to get any and all means made available to them as quickly as possible. so they can work with at least some level of comfort.This concept will work guys, it's simple and quick.I sincerely hope you are able to move in real-time, and not get caught in bureaucracy.Let me know if you have further questions.I'll be standing by.\n    "

This acts as the first temperature buffer layer, it isn't much, but it's a start. The Glycerin gel packs will buffer the temp significantly, \"warming\" the temp to around 10~15 degrees F.As the radiant cooling effect is transferred through to the contact back- plate, that temp should reach  around 50 degrees F.Add a few layers of clothing (t-shirt/scrubs), Haz suit layer, etc., and the end temp should be a comfortable 70~75 deg F.The final contact event, perspiration, will self-regulate and distribute the temperature differential throughout the body's core.Any \"adjustment\" of temperature transfer can be easily controlled by either adding or removing  layers of insulation between the Ice and the gel pack layer.(Use Styrofoam)Simple! :)\n    "

With an cooling time of 3 hours, it doesn't leave much time for actual work when it can take 30 minutes or so just to put on their suits.Between suit-up and removal, true operational work time would likely be reduced to two hours or less. working time would also be impacted by the constant high heat of the workers environment.Second, This system relies of Gel-packs as the primary means of cooling. This means refrigeration MUST be available at ALL work stations. Not feasible for more remote locations.Dry Ice can be easily made, transported and stored much more efficiently, and can even be air-dropped to remote locations.Lastly, the cooling system at best, gives 3 hours of useful work time.My CoolPak design will last for 8+hours per shift.Also, being that my CPK system is worn OUTSIDE the Hazsuit, changing/recharging the DI blocks is instant.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tSir, I know exactly how to design and build this system. I know where to source the materials and establish manufacturing.With funding, I can have a field-ready prototype in two weeks from \"go\". Another week maybe two to tweak any unforeseen variables while simultaneously defining protocol procedures for users in the field.If no major anomalies are found, The material supply entities will be already advised, and should be ready to go in real time.In short, I'm pretty confident we can have at least 1,000 units per manufacturer.If all goes according to plan (see murph...) I plan to have several manufacturers in the loop as during the proto stage. This will minimize \"spool-up\" time when a final design configuration is signed-off.The result would be say, if I hook up 5 manufacturers, theoretically we could have 5,000 units in field within 30~60 days max.The beauty of this is, it a \"Textile\"-based manufacturing process-they're fast movers, flexible, and EVERYWHERE.Guys, there's really nothing complicated about this -- start with a chosen commercial backpack. Cut a 3~4\" hole in the back.Build an inner Insulation box out of Styrofoam (back having a matching 3~4\" hole.Attach Thermal Transfer Plate assembly from common parts that can be rapidly stamped out.Press in a threaded nut at the center.Add folding wing-nut to attach.Make flat bags with Gel packs to size. Insert between TTP (i love acronyms, makes me sound like i know what i'm talking about) Insert Dri Ice (DI) block sized to fit.Go to work.Oh, and for those who are rightly wondering about the units being contaminated (given the units are external and all), there is no reason the units cannot be COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN BLEACH SOLUTION between uses or for maintenance.Note; One thing to keep in mind is these units will be out-gassing CO2. Normally this will be a non-issue, but should be addressed to consider say twenty or so Technicians working in any enclosed areas.This shouldn't be an issue given ventilation is almost a certainty in any enclosed areas. However, noting and responding for that contingency will prevent any \"oops\" stories later.\n    "
