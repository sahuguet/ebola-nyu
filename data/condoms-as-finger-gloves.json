      "message": "\n    \tThe title mislead me in the beginning, but it is an idea. Tell the people what can be done if gloves are not available. Use condoms as one of the inner layers and put a glove above. Is this possible? Or is it an option, to grab something else after removing the first outer glove? Or just produce something like a glove from other materials. Good idea to start thinking further.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            If gloves are in short supply, the second layer could consist of condoms which are cheaper to produce and likely in much higher supply than gloves. Condoms could also be easier to remove after treating a patient and be less likely to contaminate during the degowning process.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> My ideas stem from repurposing items and materials that would be readily available in the affected countries.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "This idea is for all healthcare workers who treat ebola patients. Health authorities are recommending multiple layers of gloves for treatment. One condom could be placed on each finger to serve as the second (or third) barrier. Or, perhaps only on the fingers that are most utilized during treatment (assuming thumb, pointer and third fingers).",
