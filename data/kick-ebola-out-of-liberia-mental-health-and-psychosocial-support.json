Last week they had a training with over 100 to equip them. He has formed a local NGO called Renewed Energy Serving Humanity (RESH) to focus on providing MHPSS in Monrovia. I'm sure they would love to collaborate, learn from you, share information with you, etc. They don't have a website yet but they do have a facebook page. Search for Renewed Energy Serving Humanity (RESH) and you'll see posts by him, can send him a facebook message. Or search for me and send me a message.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tFlorence, Hi.  I agree this work is very important.  I am a pediatrician in NYC.  Early in my career I cared for children with AIDS.    Many mothers did not know they were infected.  They were asymptomatic.  They learned they had HIV when they had a very ill infant who was diagnosed.  These were crisis moments.   Many children died.  Some had been orphaned, parents having died already from AIDS.  Many children are being orphaned during the ebola epidemic.   There was stigma, fear as with ebola.  Differences from the Ebola epidemic are that ebola kills quickly - there is no time to process.  Families are separated acutely.  One cannot touch their loved ones, physicians cannot touch their patients.    A focus on women and children as you are planning is very important!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During my training there was no mental health support at the workplace.    Overall stress increased.   I imagine  stress for health workers in this crisis is huge.  Is it possible to develop a program for frequent brief interventions -  reflective exercises, narrative writing etc.? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I  imagine that without MH resources in these communities the crisis will be compounded by MH problems going forward.  Great that you are initiating this work!!!   Can Mental Health workers identify the community leaders and find out how receptive they are to your planned interventions?  If they can become educated it might be easier to access members of their communities.As you have carried out a pilot and it has been well received, considering the scope of the problem, have you considered utilizing community members and training them to initiate some interventions themselves? or utilizing them as agents to recruit others to groups?Keep up this great work!\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThank you so much for sharing Bettina!!We always begin by making contact with community leadership; so that is how we do the community entry work., find the leadership, link to the Ebola Task Force and work through them to identify the issues as well as the people who need support. Then through word of mouth and cascading information, we get to more and more people who need support. Finding people is not the problem, it is the lack of resources to cover all the people who come forward, then sustaining it for the duration that is required...10 to 12 weeks...The next step after we work with providing support to people in the community is to see whom we could train to then continue with this work in their community, as we move on to initiate support in a new community.The challenge is resources....\n    "

This really builds support and a system which might even grow into a counseling and support network for the future.What do you mean by resources?  Human capital?  Financial?  Tracking information?  Are there any local mechanisms in place to gather resources or is the approach to contact NGOs and foreign aid organizations?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHello Florence, great post! Mental health and psycho social support (MHPSS) is definitely an important part of the Ebola treatment plan. Survivors and orphan children are isolated because of the fear caused by inaccurate information about the illness, and families are left without an opportunity to give proper closure to the loss of their beloved ones. It must be very hard for the relatives of the deceased not only to see a beloved one go through a painful illness, but also to be unable to provide what their beliefs dictate is a proper transition into the afterlife. I don't know much about the funeral rituals that are practiced in the affected areas, but would there be a way to incorporate any of the ritual elements to the current burial practices for Ebola victims without compromising the safety of the attendants?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThank you for you post Ursula. Due to how infectious the person is when they are terminally ill, as well as the corpse right after death, relatives are not allowed any kind of contact. There are two common scenarios: One is that the patient is taken away to the Ebola Treatment Unit, the relatives are not allowed inside to visit, the patient dies, and the relatives do not see the body. The body is cremated. All the information the relatives get, if they are lucky, is that the person died and was cremated. So the relatives sometimes cannot accept that the person died, they begin to believe the myths going round that the Government is taking kidneys to sell them...The second scenario is the person dies in the house, the Ebola Response Ambulance is called, the body is taken away and cremated. As soon as someone dies in the house, the other household members are taken to an isolation/quarantine site, or advised not to sleep in the house until the body is removed and the house is sprayed. Contact with the body and personal burials are not carried out.The normal rituals, at least in Liberia, is to have a \"sitting on the mat\" when close family and friends and relatives observe a wake. Then someone who has lost a relative will shave the hair of a close family member, they eat certain kinds of food. Before Ebola, the body is present, the close family, like wife, would cry and handle the body. All this cannot happen now, wakes are not allowed, no meetings in the houses of the person who has just died.What we are advising the families is to wait until the Ebola epidemic is over, then maybe they can have a family function, have a photo, have a service, have the \"sitting on the mat\" ceremony. They will do this once the epidemic is over. the Government also plans a National day.... It is difficult to have closure without observing the normal rituals, so some of the MHPSS issues we find are due to this.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n<strong>How it will work</strong>:\n<br/> So far, there are 20 trained MHCs, trained to provide individual and family MHPSS. These were trained through the UAF Africa project. An additional 50 SWs and 8 MHCs were trained by UNICEF to also provide MHPSS. The Carter Center Mental Health Program in Liberia (MHPL) also trained 8 MHCs so they can do counselling for survivors. The first step will be to map who has been trained, what have they been trained in, where are they providing services and what are the needs for services country wide.\n<br/>\n<br/> The next step will be to design a training program, to build up knowledge and skills in those who are already trained, and then to identify which among them will be trainers and supervisors. the idea is to use a cascade model. Those with the skills to be trainers will recieve additional training as trainers.\n<br/>\n<br/> We will then develop a coordinated approach to cascading out the training to partner agencies and to most affected acounties., with a supervision plan to go with it.\n<br/>\n<br/> As training is carried out, the MHPSS and Community Healing Dialogues will also be rolled out.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Why we think it will succeed</strong>:\n<br/> We have already carried out a \"pilot\" with the UAF Africa proejct and the communities are very very grateful for the support provided, there is a huge demand for more people to provide individual and family support, as well as the Community Healing Dialogues. Those who have been supported already indicate that they found it very helpful, no one had addressed these needs, they were not sure what to do.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Questions for the Community</strong>:\n<br/> If anyone in the community has worked in MHPSS in any of the other affected communities, please share your experiences...there seems to be nothing on MHPSS on this site.\n        </div>",

There will be a more targeted intervention for HCWs and other response personnel, such as ambulance drivers, the mortuary personnel, and the cremation workers. We will also target women and children. Interventions will be carried out in the communities, as well as in the Ebola Treatment units, and the new Ebola Care centers that are being established.",
