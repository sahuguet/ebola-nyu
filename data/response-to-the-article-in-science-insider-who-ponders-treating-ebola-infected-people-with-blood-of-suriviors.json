We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "This idea is for WHO, scientists and other organizations related to the EBOLA issue. My take on this article is simple, take action NOW not LATER. Personally, I'm content with the convalescent serum treatment to deal with the virus. It's a simple process which involves taking the blood from individuals who have recovered from the virus and transferring that blood to others who are currently fighting the virus. Aspects to support this solution include the fact that we have implemented this treatment in the past so we have slight knowledge on convalescent serum. Also there is an efficient number of people who have recovered from Ebola which can result in more people being helped. Action should be taken now so the treatment can be efficient.",
