Each team has responsibility for approximately 2,000 individuals in the\u00a0neighborhood of that location. They will live in place during the period of action. They will set up a facility, mostly outdoors (under a canopy, weather depending)\u00a0for food distribution, screening and medical care for individuals who do not have symptoms of Ebola (\"screening station\"). They will separately set up, only where\u00a0needed, a care facility for those who have sufficiently defined symptoms of Ebola (\u201cEbola care facility\").\n<br/>\n<br/> The number of Care teams needed for Sierra Leone initially is roughly 3,000 (6 Million / 2,000). This number may be somewhat reduced if there are regions of the\u00a0country that are pre-cordoned and have no identified cases.\n<br/>\n<br/> 2) Public communications teams, perhaps including local clerics and PR experts:\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Public communication teams drive/ride/walk through neighborhoods and use megaphones to inform the community.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This includes\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0a: specific instructions (relevant to actions below) and\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0b: general information messages about\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0avoiding any contacts that are not absolutely necessary,\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0being in contact only with a very few essential family and friends,\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0staying at home or within community,\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0not traveling to other locations,\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0etc.\n<br/>\n<br/> The number of Public communication teams is determined by having enough to go through neighborhoods multiple times per day. They should avoid direct contacts. Perhaps they should be assigned to a specific set of neighborhoods.\n<br/>\n<br/> 3) Food: Daily food will be dropped off for each neighborhood at the food and screening station. We don\u2019t detail the food supply system but assume that this will\u00a0include basic foods from the existing food supply of the country diverted from local markets and food processing facilities to the care provider stations, or\u00a0specially shipped food supplies where necessary. The food will be pre-packaged for individual pickup without need for contact among people, and without one\u00a0person taking the food for another. The packaging can be done before drop off at the neighborhood location or after drop off at the neighborhood location by\u00a0additional recruited individuals (who are screened for disease).\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> 4) Screening: All occupants of the neighborhood will pick up the food at the neighborhood screening station. They can choose initially which station to go to, but\u00a0must go to the same one every day afterwards. (They will be informed to do so by megaphone). They will be photographed (iPad) and the photograph will be\u00a0used for a checkoff list subsequently. Repeated photographing by iPad at each visit serves as a definite record. Each time they pick up food they undergo\u00a0screening for fever by IR detector. The screening itself (i.e. pointing the IR detectors) may be done by individuals recruited from the neighborhood and need not\u00a0be done by the medical care provider. There will be no physical contact during screening and food pickup. The pick up will be at least once a day (if logistics\u00a0make this possible, twice a day should be required). The individuals will be told to come at the same time(s) each day (though there will be no penalty if they\u00a0don\u2019t). If there is need for people to stand in line in this process (to be avoided by making the logistics work very smoothly) then markings on the ground should\u00a0delineate regions that each individual should be in as they advance one place in line at a time to prevent contact. Babies and children accompany parents.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Notes: I am not detailing the medical process of care for those who show fever. This may include separating likely Ebola cases from cases that may not be\u00a0Ebola, as well as treatment of other medical conditions. This may include having one or more \u201cpending care areas\u201d separate from the Ebola care facility and\u00a0limiting contact between individuals. I assume medical authorities will provide appropriate instructions. See however, note below in the \u201cDiscussion\u201d about\u00a0neighborhood based care providing advantage in terms of transmission.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> As indicated, every individual must pick up food for themselves, with exceptions only for the disabled. The disabled may be checked on but this is not essential.\u00a0The community may report their illness and they are not likely to have much contacts.\n<br/>\n<br/> As indicated, every individual will be screened for fever before picking up food.\n<br/>\n<br/> 5) Ebola Care Facility: If an individual is determined to be a likely case of Ebola, he/she will be directed to the neighborhood Ebola care facility, which is either a\u00a0separate tent or a home nearby that is requisitioned for this purpose. It may be one of the homes of a feverish person. But only if this is sufficiently convenient.\u00a0The care will be provided or supervised by 1 of the medical care providers, and they will be protected by 1 of the police or military individuals. The subteam responsibilities\u00a0(screening and Ebola care) will not be switched. Transfer of sick individuals to a hospital can be done if the transport is low risk for transmission and there are enough hospital beds.\n<br/>\n<br/> 6) Work and pay: People will have time on their hands and we need to have something for them to do. This may include work, recreation or entertainment.\u00a0Recommendation: Pay them for the work and pay them to study. Recruit them for pay for all the tasks that are needed for: food distribution, care,\u00a0guarding, as well as community improvement through building, cleaning, washing, etc. \u00a0Put the Army Corp of Engineers in charge of this. They should\u00a0have one person on each team who will plan and coordinate the work and provide for pay. Note that the work and pay will provide incentives for people to remain\u00a0in the neighborhood, and will serve to cover rents and other costs not covered by food delivery.\n<br/>\n<br/> 7) Region types and cordon for quarantine:\n<br/>\n<br/> Note that until this point there is no explicit quarantine, i.e. blockade, in this scenario. The behavioral recommendations, the availability of food, and the early\u00a0detection and care, nevertheless are expected to limit travel and reduce contact.\n<br/>\n<br/> We identify three types of Neighborhoods:\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A) Neighborhoods in which individuals are identified with Ebola.\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0B) Neighborhoods of monitoring of fever and delivery of food.\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0C) Neighborhoods in which conventional reporting of illness to medical authorities is being practiced.\n<br/>\n<br/> A cordon enforced by military or police should be enforced separating regions of Type A and regions of Type C. Type B regions may be on one side or other of the\u00a0cordon.\n<br/>\n<br/> 8) Time of initial travel shut down: Initially the entire country will be shut down (excepting areas where there has already been an enforced boundary separating them\u00a0from areas of disease). The initial shut down period may be somewhat shorter than a single incubation period, but 21 days is still safest. At this point regions will be identified of Type A, Type B or Type C. Type A regions have detected cases of Ebola, Type B regions are\u00a0geographically proximate to Type A regions but have no cases of their own, and Type C regions are those without cases and with geographical buffers between\u00a0them and regions of type A (consisting of regions of Type B).\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Because the regions of Type C have buffers between them and regions of Type A, the probability that cases will be detected there in the last few days of the\u00a0latent period is relatively small (it is larger due to an exponential growth of cases as the transmission probability is highest in the last days before the shut down). After the initial period, Type C Neighborhoods\u00a0can be identified and the regions of Type C neighborhoods can be reverted to traditional process of disease reporting.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Every few days Neighborhoods can be reassigned to Type A, B and C. With the intent that Neighborhoods shift from A to B to C. \u00a0Sick individuals or validated\u00a0healthy individuals (by process of individual isolation and monitoring) may be moved from neighborhood to neighborhood during this process, either to aggregate\u00a0cases or to move healthy people to healthy neighborhoods. The practicality and protocols for such movements can be evaluated separately from this\u00a0specification.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Rural areas:\n<br/>\n<br/> In rural contexts there are networks of villages along paths that often are inaccessible to automobile transportation. In these areas, a first\u00a0assessment of the presence of Ebola can identify regions that require care providers. Areas where cases have not yet been identified should be\u00a0isolated to the extent possible at point of entry. Communication with local leaders about the reasons for isolation are critical. These areas rely\u00a0upon subsistence agriculture and hunting and therefore do not require food supplies from the outside, nor do they require monitoring for Ebola\u00a0unless cases are reported. Where there are cases, the isolation boundary should occur at a finer scale, down to an individual village level. Care\u00a0providers should be present at the level at which cases have been determined.\n<br/>\n<br/> Discussion:\n<br/>\n<br/> The early detection and care of individuals that just show fever should dramatically reduce the transmission rate. This is the key to rapid reduction in the\u00a0incidence of new cases. The local care of individuals will further reduce contact between Ebola cases and non-Ebola cases as neighborhoods that don\u2019t have\u00a0Ebola will not send their sick people to medical facilities with Ebola patients. Note that care providers will not generally move from neighborhood to neighborhood\u00a0to avoid being vectors of transmission. They move from neighborhoods that have been cleared (i.e. that shift from Type B to Type C) to neighborhoods of Type A\u00a0to provide more care there and are reorganized to work under the supervision of the local team. In some cases, responsibility for supervision may be shifted to\u00a0teams that have developed improved ways to perform the efforts involved.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Roll out:\n<br/>\n<br/> Ideally this would be tested for a few days in a few local areas (urban and rural) to ensure that the daily process is smooth, and then rapidly rolled out to the\u00a0entire country. If there is need for delay due to time for recruiting of teams, it might be rolled out region by region as teams are recruited and trained about the\u00a0procedures. We suggest that the response described here be organized and overseen by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, as the coordination of large projects is precisely their expertise. They can\u00a0identify and engage those who need to do the tasks themselves.\n        </div>",

Quarantine requires providing food for everyone, which is the largest scale essential activity, so we\u00a0focus on leveraging early detection of illness and subsequent isolation and care on the food distribution process.
