Are there capabilities to track suspected versus confirmed cases, deaths, population, etc.? Perhaps data from Health Map (http://www.healthmap.org/en/) could be pulled in as well? The trick will likely be in getting data into the map in as real-time as possible, which could be tricky in these communities!\n    "

You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to  your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

MSF has been working with a group called Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), have a look at their work on Ebola here: http://hot.openstreetmap.org/projects/west_africa_ebola_epidemicWe plan to integrate their open source base map data into the map view of our application. The challenge for GIS in this outbreak is how to best collect the information, then how to share it with people on the ground fighting the disease in a way that is useful to their daily activities.\n    "

Google maps now also allows adding information from spreadsheets. \u00a0And, because Google also provides satelite images one can see the terrain, housing density, etc of an area.\u00a0\n<br/> Is is possible to create a map, with layers as needed, for Ebola tracking in the West African countries?
