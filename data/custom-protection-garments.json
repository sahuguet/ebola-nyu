  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            If getting protective clothing is critical, engage communities/schools/recreationg groups to take boring, white protective clothing and decorate it in an appealing way. \u00a0There could be a contest in school art classes for designs that are more likely to be worn. It could also be an educational opportunity to learn more about African culture and design. \u00a0Rather than designs that mimic North American culture, there could be some video (or print) materials that describe the different cultures in each country where Ebola is found. \u00a0The challenge would be to create great designs, and paint them on the protective clothing to be sent to Africa. \u00a0There could be designs for teenagers, adults, senriors, etc.\n        </div>",
