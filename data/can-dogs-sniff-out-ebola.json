      "message": "\n    \tHi, interesting thought. Perhaps something to think about is whether or not they would also be exposed to the virus and how we might ensure that they do not become a factor responsible for spreading it. Cancer is not contagious, where as Ebola in certain stages has a high risk. Also would this exposure violate animal rights in anyway? Looking forward to seeing this idea develop. Feel free to update your post with questions or needs from the community!\n    "

You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"
