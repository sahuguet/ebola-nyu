You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

      "message": "\n    \tI like where this is going. A Solar 'boost' and a hard shell would add unit endurance in a daytime environment.Couple of questions if I may; What stage of development is this design?What kind of ABS resin are you using? I would think a hardened plastic would be best suited when you know these things are going to be taking a beating.Secondly, most ABS \"surfaces\" are kinda rough when you look up close, and to a Microbe, great hiding places (note: if you're a Microbe, you know who you are).\u00a0A hardened/coated surface would really help with decon.Speaking of decon, I wonder if an \"anti-bacterial\" chemical could be added to the resin mix? (self-decon effect?) As I recall, there are products like Cutting Boards that are anti-microbial impregnated.Polymers and ABS aren't that terribly different... ?Sidebar thought(s);I'm not familiar with your construction materials, so pls forgive if it's redundant -- do you use round tubing for your thermal distribution?I crunched some numbers a found a flattened, \"ribbon-like\" tubing increased thermal transfer (exposed square surface area) significantly vs. round.Only limitation was some lateral bending limitation along the y axis, but unless you're wanting to do hard 90's, it shouldn't be much of an issue.Another note; I been giving some thought to low-power pump designs. Have a few thoughts., but I'd like your input at the ground-level before I invest much time.NOTE: Author rambles from time-to-time. :/\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tGreat questions.... The ABS will be coated with no porous coating. The  Polymers are a little proprietary (secrete sauce ) we use a patented tubing that has a no-kink feature with baffles for flow control... remember COLD is unconformable COOL and consistent is much more effective :) The system is being tested as we speak for thermal regulation and ice life.. It runs the same exact pumps etc as our hard 12 & 18 Liter Hospital/Surgeon Cooling Systems... We just designed a wearable ergonomic backpack... It has been on our product roadmap for 18 months...\n    "
