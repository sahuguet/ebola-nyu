The objective is that by the end of January 2015 the virus will not have spread to any of our US based first responders, research for treatment / cure / detection is in more advanced stage, containment and control will continue to be implemented to see a downward trend of the virus and the public perception of US involvement is seen as a positive role in this crisis. US sponsored university will have made a significant contribution to identify a vaccination or cure through crowd sourced efforts. Funding in the amount of $13,775,000 is requested for labor resource, research tools and materials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n<br/> Statement of Need\n<br/> The Ebola virus has been spreading with tremendous speed and with a very high mortality rate, up to 90% in some epidemics. There are three main countries massively affected by this outbreak so far\u2014all in West Africa. Widespread transmission has been identified in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea; however there is very serious concern that there may already be localized transmission in neighboring countries including Nigeria and Ivory Coast.\n<br/> There have been travel-associated cases of Ebola as far as Macedonia, United States, and Senegal making the threat very real. So far, there is 100% fatality rate for Ebola in United States.\n<br/> More needs to be done to combat the spread and contain the disease while effective treatments are developed.\n<br/> Program Description\n<br/> Open source intelligence, mapping, and communication technologies will enable more effective organizational efforts for US Africom and mobilized field units, aid agencies, and local / state authorities, allow better local road efficiencies and virus prevention methods for all interested parties including local populations through a range of activities.\n<br/> This proposal has many facets. The first and potentially biggest impacting part of this proposal is to outsource or \u201ccrowd source\u201d testing and research of Ebola virus for potential cure or vaccine. Local specialized field units currently collect and analyze results on the ground. Proposal is to use Internet infrastructure, in particular fiber networks between West Africa and United States to send all complex tests for analysis at United States Universities where we have specialized equipment, faculty, local experts and huge student body ready and prepared to volunteer their time. SDSU, in particular, currently has world class team on campus.\n<br/> Second, SDSU and Center for High-Performance Computing (CHPC) could make use of its substantial computational power to create an algorithm to better identify the virus based on blood tests or oral swaps \u2013 potentially identifying positive results earlier, allowing earlier isolation and stemming spread sooner.\n<br/> Third, there is currently no central or leading place on social media communicating what the US is contributing to the effort in combatting Ebola. Some efforts by US AID (\"USAID (@USAID) | Twitter,\" n.d.), USMC (\"U.S. Marines (@USMC) | Twitter,\" n.d.) and AFRICOM (\"US AFRICOM (@USAfricaCommand) | Twitter,\" n.d.) exist but they are not joined up nor are they presenting a single unified message \u2013 there is potential for confusion and currently they are only published in English on Western social media websites. There are also duplicate and old/unused twitter accounts that are no longer in use (\"U.S. Africa Command (@africom) | Twitter,\" n.d.) but still active presenting yet more unattractive attention to the US effort \u2013 the perception could be that the US is doing nothing to help if people check the wrong twitter account. SDSU students can organize shutting of these \u2018dead\u2019 accounts. Social media can be used very importantly for a range of powerful reasons. SDSU has a unique and diverse ground of students from a range of cultures in every continent. Communicating ideas, news, and important information in a language and style appropriate to the audience on platforms they actually use (Facebook &amp; Twitter are not the most popular in some parts of Africa) is of critical importance \u2013 SDSU would use the worlds and regions biggest social media platforms to communicate field hospital locations \u2013 details in point four. One example where this would happen is in Saudi Arabia where thousands of Muslim pilgrims flock to Mecca for The Hajj. Communicating to people in their own language and style would be a very easy but powerful way for SDSU students to spread positive US generated message and informative, reliable, trustworthy information to help combat this situation.\n<br/> Fourth, using openstreetmap.org, students at SDSU could add all locations of field hospitals provided by the United States, United Kingdom, NGOs and local / state entities in-country. Cell phone penetration in Africa is over 50% in all affected countries (Tortora, 2014) so this would allow previously mentioned entities to add treatment capacity data (via cell phones) as well as allowing civilian population to deliver sick individuals to areas they can attain treatment rather than arriving at facilities that are full or closed. SDSU students can direct populations to pertinent openstreetmap.org URLs using social media campaign discussed in point three. \u00a0\n<br/> Openstreetmap.org is a very powerful tool and SDSU students are able to use Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to map very useful information. In some parts of Africa some villages only have one access road \u2013 SDSU can easily and quickly mark which roads are considered \u2018red roads\u2019 to allow locals and treatment workers not to travel on that road. Students can also use this tool to map exactly where confirmed cases break out and also mark \u2018no walk zones\u2019 to communicate where local population should avoid if possible \u2013 done using confirmed data of Ebola virus or by major treatment center locations. (Fig. 1) Worth remembering that there have been several attempts by local populations and patients to enter or leave Ebola clinics to see loved ones (\"The Fight Against Ebola (Full Length) | VICE News,\" 2014) which would all contribute to spread \u2013 if no people are in the \u2018no walk zone\u2019 the risk of spreading from these cases will be substantially lower. The ambition here is to aid the ground workers and local populations and to better control / prevent further spread of the virus.\n<br/>\n<br/> Fig. 1 \u2013 \u2018No walk zone\u2019 identified on openstreetmap.org using overlays from confirmed cases.\n<br/> Sanitation and running water are huge risks to spreading the Ebola virus. The grisly task of identifying how and where to safely / culturally dispose of fatalities is something that SDSU students and faculty from the homeland security, geology, geography and public health departments would have very sufficient skills to solve. Using OSINT and mapping tools to identify flat areas of ground (\u2018plateaus\u2019) where water would not run easily or even exist very frequently, away from wildlife that may spread the virus and somewhere with little or no downwind (toward populations) \u2013 away from civilization \u2013 this gruesome but very important task can be achieved using the information supplied by SDSU. This is a much more preferred method of disposal than leaving bodies in the streets. (\"The Fight Against Ebola (Full Length) | VICE News,\" 2014)\n<br/> SDSU would use part of any grant money to create an \u2018Aid Box\u2019 with Ebola specific protective clothing, goggles and cleaning fluids and distribute it to all major treatment centers in the United States, so that if a suspected Ebola case is reported our EMTs are better protected. We know that Ebola is spread through water and fluids which leaves our EMTs very vulnerable to contact through eyes \u2013 having a one-stop-shop standard equipment across the EMT community will lower the risk if they suspect a case until more proper containment equipment can arrive at the scene. The \u2018Aid Boxes\u2019 would be small, simple, portable, and highly available to institutions that would like them. CDC and FEMA would also be sent this equipment for wider-scale emergency management situations. There are 5723 hospitals registered in the US. Assuming each hospital in the country requires 10 units, I anticipate a total of 57,230 units with an additional 2770 units for CDC / FEMA meaning a total 60,000 units need developing, producing and shipping.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> References:\n<br/> U.S. Marines (@USMC) | Twitter.
