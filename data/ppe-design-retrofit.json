For example, if the outer gloves had a velcro or other attachment ring or tab at the sleeve opening, or a couple of rings, eyelets or holes (of some sort) that would fit over nubs or knobs on the outside of the sleeves, then perhaps the outer glove could also be removed along the PPE suit without toughing the material.  The inner gloves could also have some sort of tab or grabbing strip system that either a watcher could use or similarly be snagged and peeled off (turning inside-out) without anyone having to touch the person doffing the hazardous PPE gear.\n    "

This effort is to help PPE manufacturers think about possible alternatives based on healthcare provider input, and research that currently exists within companies based on trials, studies and other feedback.  I believe this is a process, and hope that industry finds some of our insights helpful in their assessments of current practice, to thereby make quicker improvements for the field.\n    "

Nicole - See Andy's posts on my IDEA.  He recommends a wool under layer as it is good for thermoregulation.  He posted supportive documents.

This could also help make more of a one size fits all suit that better conforms to each person's body.-A front release tab to open the back of the suit.  This would allow the operator to pull the tab at the front of their suit in order to open the seam at the back.  This way, even if gloved hands become contaminated, the operator wouldn't need to touch a zipper or tabs near the seam (which could lead to contamination) in order to exit the suit.  Also, the tab would be in a safer, snag-free (between the arms) location that could be better monitored.  -Hall effect closure sensors: With a magnet on one side of a seam and a hall effect sensor on the other side, you would be able to display a green light to the operator if all of the seams on the PPE are closed and a red light if any are open or become open during operation.  Neodymium magnets could be sewn into the fabric as could the hall effect sensors which would be wired to a simple CPU.\n    "

Something that hard working and wear for longer times, and  another thats on and off in less then an hour. I can see some of both in the ideas.  Start with the simple on and off system-needs to be something that-lets call it KISS, people put these on and off just to go into a room to give a pill. so-time and engineering ways to make it perfect every time, on and off. Im looking for a 1 piece suit, gloves and face pro included-all comes off at once-like peeling a banana-everything pulls forward-gloves and all come off-without the use of hands-so no touching of exposed surfaces. The second one-can be a bit more complicated-all the bells and whistles. The advantage is these people hopefully only get in and out once a shift, so they can take more time getting out. But again-simple is better, One piece suit-no hands needed, no use of front openings. Cooling and other systems enclosed in the system if possible. Flexible and tough-and balance that with work load and heat.There is another possibility-a system that protects the wearer like normal , but has an overcoat to protect the internal system. That way if dealing with multiple patients-maybe not contaminated, they can discard the outside and still remain in the inner system-but don another outer cover.way to think about this-think about being on your feet for 18 hrs, getting in and out 12+ times to take care of your patient, you know the procedures-youve done them enough times. Its almost time to go home-and you have to get out of your MOP suit after giving your ebola patient his meds. Can you absolutely say that you did the exact procedure each and every time, trying to remember what you touched, The MD and Nurses Im sure were asking the same thing- there has to be a better way\n    "

Reducing the overall complexity of the suit system, especially for use in high-heat or extreme environments, that increase freedom of movement and flexibility are critical and the goal of this approach.  Not sure about an outer membrane salt-based, chemical-based or spray that would help deactivate the virus or other environmental hazards as the suit is being worn - this may be especially difficult if the hazard is vomit or other large secretion in volume.  Need to defer to suit manufacturing experts based  on prior knowledge and tested results.  Appreciate the contribution!\n    "
