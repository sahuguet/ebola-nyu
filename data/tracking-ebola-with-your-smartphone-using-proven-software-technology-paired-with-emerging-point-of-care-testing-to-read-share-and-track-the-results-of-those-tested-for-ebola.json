  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            There are four key elements of Ebola testing and tracking that pose a problem for monitoring and containing the spread of the virus at present: \n<ul>\n<li>The symptoms of the infection do not surface until up to 21 days after the virus is present in your system \u2013 meaning those infected sometimes do not seek treatment before travelling or coming into contact with others</li>\n<li>Testing for the virus is a slow process involving remote labs, experienced laboratory staff, time-delayed results, no traceability of patient movements, nor the requirement to quarantine patients pending test outcomes.\u00a0 In countries with major outbreaks of disease, quarantine facilities are inadequate and likely to risk healthy people becoming exposed to the virus.</li>\n<li>Shipping virus samples regionally or internationally increases risk of accidental exposure.</li>\n<li>There is no current way of tracking, in real-time, the results and global movements of those likely to have come into contact with Ebola or those tested for Ebola.\u00a0 Nor is there a simple mechanism to collate and manage preliminary diagnostic data from potentially exposed people.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/> Novarum DX, a UK based medical app-development company, already produces smartphone applications capable of accurately reading the result of point of care tests. The app, which has been developed for testing and tracking a variety of infectious diseases including HIV and Influenza, provides instant results to all users \u2013 from clinicians to inexperienced aid workers \u2013 allowing rapid detection and treatment of disease and illness.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/contribution/17309/9112e06d-582e-4b0e-840e-7a176b9d0e6b.jpg\" style=\"height: 225px; width: 400px;\"/>\n<br/> Novarum DX Reader Apps require nothing more than the phone in your pocket. Available for use with most android, ios and/or windows phones, the app uses built-in camera functionality to read lateral flow assays more accurately than the human eye. Each app is bespoke, designed to the exact geometry of that individual test, meaning the user never obtains an inaccurate result.\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/contribution/17309/64b767dc-b966-4e6d-8545-9aad2fd1116a.jpg\" style=\"height: 150px; width: 225px;\"/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/contribution/17309/b2e1e19b-160b-4c2b-8ea5-49823d42caa1.jpg\" style=\"height: 150px; width: 207px;\"/>\n<br/> The app is fully connected, meaning: \n<ul>\n<li>Results read and displayed on the smartphone app can be instantly shared with a cloud-based, secure portal, accessible to governments, health workers and/or aid organisations</li>\n<li>Additional information can be collected alongside the test result, such as date/time of test, geographical location of test and demographics of patient \u2013 building up a picture of who and where is testing for, or appears to have, Ebola</li>\n<li>Real-time results of positive tests, people in contact with Ebola and/or people showing symptoms, can be mapped, traced and shared with governments or aid organisations where the data is required. This in turn allows fast response for treatment, quarantine and additional testing\u00a0</li>\n</ul> It is therefore proposed that, by developing an app which works in tandem with current, in-development, point of care assays for Ebola, a Novarum app, or similar, be used so that those infected with, or perceived to be in danger of contracting, Ebola can be instantly tested anywhere and have their results traced in real-time. This would provide a geographical representation to governments and global aid organisations of the movements of those at risk of Ebola; highlighting \u2018hot spots\u2019 and high-risk areas, as well as predicting (and containing) possible spread within continents outside of Africa.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> We know of point of care Ebola tests currently being developed in the USA and Europe, adapting both medical and defence technology:\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.corgenix.com/news-releases/corgenix-provides-update-on-ebola-test-kit-nih-grant/\">http://www.corgenix.com/news-releases/corgenix-provides-update-on-ebola-test-kit-nih-grant/</a>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29780942\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29780942</a>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.bbidetection.com/products/biothreat-explosives-antibody-supply/\">http://www.bbidetection.com/products/biothreat-explosives-antibody-supply/</a>\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> Even while these rapid tests are still being developed, there is an important role for mobile applications to play in tracking persons who may have been exposed, canvasing signs and symptoms regularly over the 21-day incubation period, and helping identify other potential exposures.\u00a0 As soon as rapid tests become available, these could be added to the app functionality \u201cover the air\u201d to add further information; the App could even be used to support in field trials of potential new tests.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> The rapid test and accompanying app would be most beneficial if used: \n<ul>\n<li>Within medical centres located in high-risk locations</li>\n<li>At road and air border-controls throughout Africa and global airport security points for travellers on flights departing from or arriving from high-risk locations</li>\n<li>Within world-wide hospitals where Ebola is being treated</li>\n<li>Supplies available at all hospitals in case of isolated outbreaks\u00a0</li>\n</ul> For more information on Novarum DX &amp; our mobile reader solutions, please visit \n<a href=\"http://www.novarumreader.com\">www.novarumreader.com</a>\u00a0or to read our latest article on ebola please visit \n<a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/healthcare/mobile-and-wireless/mobile-health-apps-have-role-in-ebola-crisis/a/d-id/1306617?\">informationweek</a>\u00a0or the \n<a href=\"http://www.novarumreader.com/2014/08/tracking-ebolas-outbreak-impossible-important/\">Novarum</a> website\u00a0\n        </div>",
