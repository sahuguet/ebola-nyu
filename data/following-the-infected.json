You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "Reading along an article on CNN, I came across a technique that researchers believe will work to stop Ebola. The article said people simply track the health of the infected and then watch the health of those close around them, until the disease eventually weeds itself out. The people around are tracked and if nothing happens they are let go, but if they become infected then the process begins again. I think this idea would work as it limits the number of people that become infected and it makes the disease kill itself.",
