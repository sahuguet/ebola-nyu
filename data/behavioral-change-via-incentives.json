      "message": "\n    \tHi Erdem, interesting point of view. Here's some things to think about:Have you thought about where they might source the prize money from? Are there are other types of rewards you could offer that are more aligned with health goals? How would you ensure that people didn't abuse the system, seeking the rewards even if they are not likely to have the virus?Thanks for the contribution. Feel free to ask the community for specific feedback, insights of skills to help you develop this idea :) Good luck!\n    "

Besides education, people who are (or possibly are) infected may be avoiding any tests, and exposing themselves not to be taken away from their communities. If people were offered a financial benefit to turn themselves in, then, if they survive, they would have some benefit to enjoy with their families. Once they turn themselves in, and they are checked for Ebola, they could get a prize money for this.",
