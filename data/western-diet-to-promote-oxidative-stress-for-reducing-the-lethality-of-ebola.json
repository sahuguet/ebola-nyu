      "message": "\n    \tI agree with you that Ebola has limited catalase activity but the reaction can be directed towards peroxidase enzymes. In fact, it was found that Ebola is selenium dependent which result in the existence of selenium peroxidase activity in Ebola which is one of the peroxidases in Ebola metabolic pathway.This is an interesting idea but we have to carefully consider how oxidative stress can be used. an equilibrium should exist everywhere especially when we are talking about ROS !\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tYes, it is useful to think of it as a titration in the field.  We'll start with a low inducement and check for ROS response.  We'll induce ROS in order to generate enough ROS residual throughout the body to offer more protection in the short-term.  This is analogous to the use of chlorine residual in water distribution systems, which serves to protect the bulk of the water from contact with low levels of pathogens.\n    "

  "summary": "I recently published a new hypothesis in the journal, Medical Hypotheses, which links the elevated inorganic sulfur of the Western Diet with the development of oxidative stress via ultra-exogenous sulfide formation (USF).  While oxidative stress is a chronic problem in the USA and Europe, it is absent in West Africa due to the non-Western Diet (low inorganic sulfur).  The Ebola virus doesn't appear to have catalase activity like Herpes Simplex Virus, so it should be vulnerable to H2O2 and other ROS.  A switch in the diet of West Africaners to a Western Diet rich in inorganic sulfur may induce oxidative stress and reduce the lethality of Ebola.  A faster approach would be the use of an IV bag with elevated NaHS.",
