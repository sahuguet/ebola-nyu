If the hospital floor has tiles on it studs will be an accident waiting to happen, as they are very very slippy in this environment, the same would apply to concrete, timber or any hard man made surfaces like this. Might not be a good idea to have nurses or doctors slipping all over the place and sending equipment etc flying.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHey Howard, as a designer I see it as a big drawback as it comes down to one thing, grip. The idea of studs on a football boot is to provide grip. It works because of the environment it is used in, mainly on natural surfaces like grass, and sometimes artificial surfaces. They are needed so as to be able to dig into the ground and give the player grip. The one drawback for them is that in certain conditions grass and clay can clog up the base of the boots and cause you to lose grip. So when they come into a manmade environment such as tiles, concrete or timber floors, they are ineffective for gripping as they have nothing to dig into. In fact they become a small bit dangerous as it can sometimes be easy to slip walking around on these slippy hard surfaces. I appreciate where you are coming from with the suggestion (I\u2019ve probably submitted a few mad proposals myself), however don\u2019t see it as a solution. Maybe if one was to look at making grooves along the base of the health workers shoes to lessen the amount of contact with the floor, maybe\u2026but the next drawback is any gaps like that are great for dirt or liquids to get into and be easily carried around.\n    "
