You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "A user with smartphone can obtain information about disease symptoms and a link to find more about treatment and where help is available.  The user is unaware that the approximate location of the cellphone can be estimated by triangulation among cellphone towers to within a hundred yards or so.  This information does not disclose the identity of the caller, but will be very useful for the local public health system in identifying disease hot spots so they can plan deployment of health resources.",
