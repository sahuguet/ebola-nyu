      "message": "\n    \tHi Craig, interesting idea. I wonder if you could partner with William on his idea - https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/strategic-pivot-to-home-isolation-create-new-job-title-home-isolation-counselor. How might we decentralize care by identifying and supporting homes which need care assistance? Also is there something that they already have that they could use to communicate an infected household? That would make it easier as new supplies wouldn't have to be sought out or distributed. There is a potential to frame the symbology in a way which promotes hope of recovery rather than the perception of fatal outcomes which are currently in place.Looking forward to seeing this idea grow, good luck!\n    "

How to create a simple effective communication system with the flags that won't cause households to feel ostracised ? One possibility could be the flags are flown at some more central places in the community so the collective ebola situation can be displayed,  a trusted person( possibly an ebola survivor) could be in charge of keeping track of in-home infections and keeping the flag designations current\u2026?what do you think, want to team up for a post about a potential  flag systemthanks\n    "

Like your idea of making healthcare environment less threatening for children. If skype is not convenient for you my email is craigprovost@mac.com. My wife also has some great insights as she works in healthcare and health care research maybe she will join our brainstorm too.cheers, happy halloween\n    "
