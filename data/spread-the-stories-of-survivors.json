  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Emotion is a powerful driver of behavior. In times that are full of uncertainty, hope is the most effective counter to fear. Knowing that people have successfully recovered from Ebola with proper care is the first step to having hope.\n<br/>\n<br/> Stories of survivors like\u00a0 \n<a href=\"https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/research/with-a-disease-where-you-can-t-touch-ebola-survivors-lend-a-caring-hand\">Dekontee Davis</a>\u00a0must be told. These stories show that Ebola is not an automatic death sentence and that there are people working to fight it.\n<br/>\n<br/> Stories can be told through the spoken word, through music, through art. Ideally these stories are shared through outlets that have roots in the communities.\n        </div>",
