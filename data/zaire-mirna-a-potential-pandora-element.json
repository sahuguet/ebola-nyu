  "summary": "Over the past 3 years , my research has focused on additional virulence factors besides VP35 in that comparative genomic studies did not explain the differential virulence between the species. A potential miRNA was identified within the UTR between the nucleoprotein and VP35 ORF's only in EBOV.Further analysis computationally identified homology with known human miRNAs that target multiple host immune transcripts.Further biochemical confirmation leading to RNAi as therapeutic option may prove beneficial in future outbreaks.
