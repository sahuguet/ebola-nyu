  "summary": "People in Africa have the most possibility to get Ebola virus because the people there are poor, they don't have money to buy organic food or even clean food. They don't pay attention to personal hygiene. People need to help them, donate money to them and teach them the seriously consequences of getting Ebola. The weather in Africa also causes Ebola to happen. It's too hot in Africa, people always perspire but they don't have enough water to take a shower. In addition, People live in poor areas do not have internet, they are hardly to know the knowledges about Ebola. We can provide them internet or donate money to them for buying healthy food.",
