We also hope that this could be the beginning for a longer term solution. But that might look different from what we are building at the moment. If successful, it'd be interesting to see users behaviours in real setting and adapt/iterate or redirect the project from there...For now, our next step is to prototype the concept and test it. That will probably already trigger a few improvements ;)\n    "

First of all, I find your idea is very good.A while ago I theorized a similar project, aimed at creating a network of dry toilets in urban areas: http://papirofilia.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/a-propos-des-toilettes-seches-urbaines/However, in my project, human waste is treated in a biodigestor and generates energy, instead of consuming it. Biological decomposition can destroy virus and bacteria contained in faeces. What do you think of this other possibility?\n    "

But the rest of the elements (repurposed chair with a hole, diverting funnel for urine connected to plastic bottle, and another box for solid waste) I'm sure can be found out there in the wild. I've seen (and used) dry toilets so I know that for some people (seniors, when you're sick, etc) it's hard to defecate in a squat position, so a chair frame to rest your buttocks can be convenient and easy to use.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Ariel,It's completely true what you are telling. It's nice to hear that so many people are trying to find more efficient solutions for our waste management!The original project, on which this product is based, had the same purpose you are explaining.Fluid and solid waste were on top of that divided so that they could be treated in two different ways: (1) electrolyze of urine to create electricity and (2) composting the solid waste to generate biogas and created fertiliser.An other option is also to dry out the fertiliser completely and to get bricks or bio-coals, which could be used for cooking or could be  burned afterwards in a generator (electricity).Those techniques do unfortunately require technological knowledge and equipment which is extremely expensive (especially in the case of the electrolyze). The area touched by Ebola is most of the times not equipped to be able to execute this process in an efficient and  most important safe way.First we need to design solutions to tackle a disease. Afterwards the focus can be changed towards design for environment/ecology.Therefore we focused first on the creation of a cheap, safe and rapidly implementable product; giving a fast response on this global threat.Thanks for your comment. It's great to have some discussions, it's really helpful.\n    "

The idea is that these be biodegradeable bags, although \"biodegradeable\" bags apparently only do so under very specific conditions, and they create dependance on the providers of these bags, unlike the Minimalist UDDT which I propose (as it depends on rescuing a few bits of plastic from the garbage ... and is so inexpensive that each could be for individual use).         The bags can also be placed on a cardboard box to facilitate use.           I could not find the attachment. Please guide me in that direction.      I also think it is unlikely people would want to carry their excrement around with them, plus this would constitute a new health risk, with these potetially spilling or failing, unlike the minimalist system, in which sacks can be buried.\n    "

Seems being leak and spill proof would be primary with blocking bad smells possibly being secondary but sell important ( to avoid social stigma). Could something like a small low cost plastic flip top garbage bin, plus back pack straps, plus wipe/wipe dispenser/ plus proper sized bag inserts do the trick. Maybe larger sized zip locks could be used so that each time waste is individually sealed and then tossed into another bag liner of the container ( double containment and this could help with smell)Do you also imagine this would be used for uriniation or only #2 situations?Anyhow amazing concept\n    "

What I like about your idea is that it empowers the local population, and reduces dependance. 1,7 million Liberians currently defecate in the open and I'm wondering how we can motivate them to use the personal portable toilet. Would it motivate or deter them if they have to build the unit? From my understanding urine has a lower risk of contamination but still represents a risk. So we're building the concept including it from a technical perspective. We need to see if it hinders compliance and see if we should compromise. I'll need further guidance on the risk/benefit of leaving it out. To be continued...Thanks for your support and contribution!\n    "
