  "summary": "My idea is creating a suit that will keep the medical staff cool while they are working in Africa. As of right now, they are working on patients in a hot suit with no way to cool off except by taking the suit off. This is a hazard because they could catch the virus as well. If we created a suit that has a system to control the temperature by using the heat as energy. It would be keep the workers cool and let them continuously work on the patients.",
