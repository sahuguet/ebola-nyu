You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

Iodine Sublimates at a relatively low temperatures, so theoretically you could sublimate Iodine into the fabric to make it have antiseptic properties.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThe cost will depend on the quantity made. A starting point for the manufacturing cost would be from USD$1.35  SQM.  Material cost and Iodine cost would depend on quantity purchased, both are much cheaper in mass. Polyester Whicking material suitable for an underlay starts at USD$0.90 SQM. Any material made of Polyester/Microfibre/Lycra/Birdseye can be sublimated.  Sublimation paper is $0.25 SQM lower if used in mass production. Many major factories are currently in operation worldwide producing sublimated clothing, all we would require is iodine to trial the effectiveness of the material at a sublimated garments factory. I have experience in sourcing and producing sublimated garments/materials. Possibly, I can arrange a trial of this material at my sourcing factory in Shanghai, China for no charge.\n    "
