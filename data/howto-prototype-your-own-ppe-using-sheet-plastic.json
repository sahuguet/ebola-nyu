  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            You'll need:\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0- Plastic sheet. \u00a0I used 1.5mil (polyethylene, I believe) sheet. \u00a0Here's some 2mil sheet from home depot, 10x100feet for $21:\u00a0http://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-10-ft-x-100-ft-Clear-2-mil-Plastic-Sheeting-RS210-100C/202184044\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0 - An ordinary household clothes iron\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0 - Scissors to cut the plastic\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0- Tracing paper or parchment to protect the iron from getting stuck to the plastic. \u00a0Ordinary paper should also work. \u00a0It's also a good idea to put parchment on your work surface to protect it from the melted plastic.\n<br/>\n<br/> The suit I made was very simple (and incomplete): two tubes for my legs, two tubes for my arms, and a tube for my torso. \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> I made the suit in the photo on an ordinary workbench. \u00a0For my second attempt, I made the plywood fixture you see in the photos, which made it easy to loop the plastic under the wood, then clamp it in place with binder clips for easy joining with the iron.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
