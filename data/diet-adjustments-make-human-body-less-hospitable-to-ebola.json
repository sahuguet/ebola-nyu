You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "summary": "The Ebola virus has specific requirements for nutrients, in this case, amino acids, to survive and replicate.  The amino acid l-arginine is essential for ebola.    The West African diet is arginine-rich, which may explain the particular virulence of this virus in that part of the world.  Through simple dietary adjustments we can effectively slow down viral replication and facilitate the immune system's ability to respond.",
