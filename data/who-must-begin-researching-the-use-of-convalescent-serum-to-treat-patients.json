  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            WHO is currently trying to come up with ways to fight this severe outbreak and they have several ideas. One key idea that has the potential for success is the convalescent serum which uses blood transfusions from cured patients to treat infected ones. However, this also comes with risk regarding the spread of hepatitis C and HIV. Because this outbreak is so severe, I believe the risk must be taken. There's too much on the line for WHO to not act so\u00a0I believe that although there is great risk, all options need to be considered and if this is the best option, then it must be put into action.\n        </div>",
