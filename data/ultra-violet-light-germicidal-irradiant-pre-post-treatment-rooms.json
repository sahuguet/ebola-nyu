You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

UV lights are only about 50% efficient in converting input power to UV light.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "It is known that UV light transmissions in the correct wavelength and intensity have the ability to render Ebola inactive.  Even though the ebola virus is not necessarily destroyed by UV, it is rendered inactive and incapable if causing infection.With that being said, it seems to me that we could develop pre / post treatment rooms through which medical staff could pass after being in contact with ebola patients ( especially prior to removing protective suits).  These rooms could be as simple as a sea container outfitted with UV lighting on walls and windows.  Because UV generating equipment is very energy inefficient, the containers could be fabricated with their own power generating (such as a hybrid renewable / fossil fuel system)",
