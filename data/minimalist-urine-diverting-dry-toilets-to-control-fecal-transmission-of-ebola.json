I like very much this simple and clever idea for diverting the urine and the faeces :)Vanessa Counaert, whose project is featured today, just encouraged me to share with you this project I wrote some time ago to treat human waste: http://papirofilia.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/a-propos-des-toilettes-seches-urbaines/I think many of the ideas that are being shared in this forum can be connected, your system being the first end of the chain, then a distribution network and a treatment network. What do you think about this?\n    "

The part for urine is made from 2 bottles pulled out of the garbage (which could even be Coke bottles) and, with even the urine being infectious with Ebola, that can be emptied into shallow holes in the ground among crop plants and covered up. The feces are collected in empty rice sacks, covered with soil and before they get too heavy they can be buried in the ground, as near as possible to each home, to protect against Ebola transmission. After a year or more, the sacks can get dug up to use the great soil in agriculture and re-use the sacks for collecting more feces.

Chlorine in contact with organic substances forms the extremely toxic family of chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as DDT and Dioxin. In combination with urine, it forms the toxic gas Trichloramine. The use of chlorine and toxic chemicals should be limited to disinfecting surfaces, where they can evaporate (and only contaminate the air a bit). All we need to protect against Ebola spreading out of these collections of excrement is a layer of soil (and to make sure that animals do not dig there).\n    "

The urinal could get rinsed with some disinfectant AFTER emptying it into the soil and BEFORE the next person's use.Here is a truly WILD IDEA to be tested: Ebola is transmitted from person to person, not through the ecosystem, so let's try to eliminate this virus by washing surfaces with the diverse ecosystem of bacteria and yeast in Water Kefir (or other fermented drinks). In this way, we could use something non-toxic and locally produced, instead of the inverse. Is there a lab that could test this for us?\n    "

This is a Minimalist UDDT and, once people get their minds around the concept, they can build nicer, more permanent models. ---- Some people are concerned that I use permeable, woven sacks, but these are extremely strong, inexpensive, accessible and re-usable, plus they allow water to evaporate out and oxygen to get in, so normal decomposition can take place and it all just become normal, healthy, rich soil. The disease containment is done by the dry soil we use to cover the feces and the sack just holds it all together and keeps smell and flies from coming and going. Any time there is excess liquid, more dry soil and wood ash can be added. If the sack is directly on top of ambient soil, these liquids can absorb directly into the soil, and --don't worry-- no one will want to touch this soil and it gets covered immediately by the next sack. ---- What do you think?\n    "
