The program includes working with and training community leaders who will then go on to work with their communities and Ebola survivors.  https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152824433279136.1073741935.238566664135&type;=1Looks promising -\"IsraAID has been selected to lead the psychosocial aspect of the operation in this multinational effort, with the World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders and the International Red Cross allocating the tasks in coordination with the governments in West Africa. \" from: http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/israel_prepares_to_fight_ebola_in_west_africa\n"

Meena posted a comment on my idea, which you built on here, asking - \"I wonder what diaspora networks we might tap to help us learn more about trusted local leaders in West Africa?\"  I think this is a great point.  I realized that at my job site there are many West Africans.  I plan to ask them about this.  \u00a0Do either of you have any thoughts about Meena's suggestion?\n    "

It is easiest to find the on the ground as face to face is an important feature of trust in these countries as a foreigner. Usually my driver/fixer knows who they are or can find them in minutes once we reach the community we are researching in.\n    "

Do you know if these traditional structures and leaders are also in West African communities here in the USA and other Western countries?  What is the role of the chiefs?  Do they make laws?  decisions on family matters and health issues?  Would the chiefs decide if their communities can accept a vaccination for example?Are you familiar with the local culture in Liberia and Guinea as well?Thank you.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tFor Sierra Leone and in general Paramount Chiefs are in the rural communities only, they are voted in by the community but for the most part they fall by lineage. There is a level below the Paramount (I am blanking on what they are called) and they are sometimes in the city but rarely; or the Paramount Chief comes to the city to deal with business there as well as community issues. The Chiefs deal with community dissent, can decide on punishment and guilt, finances, disputes and they represent the community at the government level. Of late there are new laws that forbid the Chiefs from dealing with gender based violence cases BUT this is not really stopping them. The Chief has a counsel as well but overall he is the be all and end all of the decisions made. So yes, they make decisions of all types including gender issues. I am very familiar with Liberia but not Guinea.\n    "

Will let you know what I discover.  Thanks for the info Lynn.  One other question.  How large would a community be that one Chief leads?  It is interesting that they represent the community at the government level.   Understanding these dynamics and layers in each society is so important to approaching public health issues, in crisis or in prevention campaigns.  Building these connections now can only strengthen collaboration going forward.  Are the Chiefs open to discussion with Western women or is a face to face regarding something as important as education re: Ebola Virus Disease only possible with a man?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Alex.  I spoke with a woman at my work place who is originally from Nigeria.  Her family is there, located in the capital and also her mother lives in a rural village.  She told me that \"in Nigeria people think that ebola was brought there by Americans who were doing tests.  They just didn't think it would get this big this fast.\"  She did not have any notion about ebola from a religious point of view.  She was firm in her belief that everyone there thinks that this disease \"is not from Africa, it was brought to Africa.\"  She did say there was extension of beliefs from rural areas to cities as people migrate back and forth.  I wonder if this notion that she reports is common in the countries currently effected by the epidemic.  Seems there are many ideas about this illness that elicit distrust with and  interfere with care seeking from Western health workers.(I will try to speak with others about this topic next week as well.)\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            I would like to see community teams assembled consisting of Western medical personnel and NGO representatives, and local government officials, religious leaders and traditional healers. Local leaders could provide Westerners information about what is needed at ground level in terms of funding and equipment, as well as what sort of strategies might improve community trust. Western personnel could provide local representatives with information about how to recognize, contain and treat Ebola, as well as equipment to help manage infections in the community (i.e. buckets and chlorine to set up handwashing stations at churches and healing centres; masks, gloves and other PPE to protect community members caring for those who are sick).\n<br/>\n<br/> To date, much of the focus on local belief systems and healing practices has been paternalistic - framing it as something that is simply ignorant/nefarious and must be overcome. But there are deep, historical reasons why local belief systems exist, and it makes no sense to try and overturn them, when instead we could work within them to formulate protocols that make sense in the context of these communities. (This is essentially a paragon of the need for participatory design practices.)\n<br/>\n<br/> Another important consideration that has been raised is how to develop language for the crisis that fits in with local beliefs. For example, some believe that uttering the name of the disease summons it - so it may improve care-seeking outcomes to work with the kind of language that villagers use when seeking traditional care.\n<br/>\n<br/> Questions for the community:\n<br/> How can we organize teams of Western personnel and community leaders?\n<br/> What are some of the magicoreligious beliefs that are held in West Africa with respect to Ebola?\n<br/> What kind of language do people in West Africa use to describe Ebola/illness in general?\n<br/> Can we work with West African diaspora to start developing this language?\n        </div>",
