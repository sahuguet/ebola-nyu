If there are infected bats\u2014or primates used as protein\u2014in the process of butchering them, a person gets in contact with blood.\n<br/>\n<br/> How does it move from person to person?\n<br/>\n<br/> It's not easily transmitted. But there's this ritual behavior [in some areas, where] they wash bodies by hand to prepare for burial\u2014a loving way of sending the spirit into the next world. This kind of behavior brings people into very close contact with body fluids that are infected, and that's how people become infected.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Typically these outbreaks are relatively easy to control if you can get people to stop washing dead bodies.\"<br/> <br/> Solution 1: Provide better source of protein.<br/> Solution 2: Envolve religious leaders, for a better monitoring and ensuring the best practices on burial rituals.</strong>\n</div>",
