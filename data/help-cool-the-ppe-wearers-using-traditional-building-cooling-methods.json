      "message": "\n    \tGreat point Rebecca. Using passive cooling to reduce temperatures in work environments can help alleviate heat strain for healthcare workers in PPE suits. You should check out the Butaro Hospital that was designed and built by the MASS Design group in Rawanda. The design used natural ventilation and layout strategies to reduce the transmission of airborne diseases - which also significantly reduced the temperature of patient wards through passive cooling. The hospital was built from what was available locally - in terms of using local materials and building techniques. http://www.archdaily.com/165892/butaro-hospital-mass-design-group/\n"
