Another thing to keep in mind is that in more remote areas, these \"community\" centers serve people from sometimes up to several kilometers away - I wonder if people would be willing to travel these distances (it can be hard to encourage this for preventative care).\n    "

Centers should be be open in design (separate from health care centers), feel inviting and familiar, and be organic in architectural design within the community.\n<br/> Questions:\n<br/> 1. Are there already areas of assembly that offer such education within the community? Or can education be added to such centers?\n<br/> 2. Should such centers be near schools and/or health care centers?\n<br/> 3. Will such education centers be welcomed by members of the community, or will it instill more fear or reluctance to seek care? How can the education center's design be more organic to the community in a way that will encourage discussion, collaboration, and further education on Ebola and other health care issues?\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
