      "message": "\n    \tAs stated, using an existing cooling technology would be the quickest and most effective solution to rapidly assist the health care workers. We at TechNiche International manufacturer all three of your suggested Cooling Technologies: Evaporative, Phase Change and Circulatory.  Some quick thoughts:- Evaporative Cooling -This will not work well under a PPE suit as there is not enough airflow to evaporate the water in the garment. This technology cools based on the ambient temperature and is not suitable to be worn in a confined area.  COST - least expansive at roughly $45.00 per unit- Circulatory Cooling -Each vest requires its own power source causing individuals to be tied to a stationary unit outside of their PPE or using a power source that is self-contained. COST - most expansive at roughly $400.00 - $500.00 per unit- Phase Change Cooling - Cooling packs maintain a 58\u00b0F/14\u00b0C regardless of body temperature, humidity and ambient environment for 2-3 hours. Vests containing the Phase Change Cooling inserts are worn under PPE suits without the need of an external power source. The packs recharge in as little as 25 minutes in a freezer or ice water. COST - Each vest roughly sells for $169.99As we are a current manufacturer of all three technologies, we think the Phase Change Cooling option to be the best option based on cost, cooling effectiveness and cooling duration. Here is a link to our IDEA using one of our technologieshttps://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/cooling-vests-to-keep-ebola-heat-care-workers-safe-from-heat-stress\n"

It seems to me that keeping the temperature down and removing moisture would both be important. Your idea in conjunction with the desiccant idea might work well.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tFor remote areas that have no access to refrigeration or electricity, a desiccant could be used in place of the cool packs.  Desiccant is a material that absorbs liquid from the air like the material found in pill bottles or beef jerky to keep food dry.  The desiccant can be recharged to absorb more liquid when it is heated up.  This is a completely different idea altogether since it doesn't actually cool the individual but simply dries them.  This however may be sufficient if it allows the care worker to work longer than the 45 minutes.  A dry care worker may be able to tolerate the dry heat longer than being inside PPE that is fogged up and soaked in ones own sweat.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThe most promising solution would also be the cheapest and easiest to implement which would involve use of passive cooling technologies as it does not require an energy source to plug in.   I would narrow it down to PPE that is modified to have pockets that allow it to carry ice-packs (which may last for 30min to  an hr) or PCM packs (that can last up to a few hours)  and the PPE that has thermal conductive zones to allow natural cooling to the environment.  This all assumes that the care workers have access to a freezer that they could recharge these packs daily.  PCM or ice packs are not any more expensive than the PPE itself.I'm not sure how I would prototype this.  I'm just a guy with a garage :)  To prototype I would need a few sets of the exact PPE that is used, some thermal conductive materials, and some packs of PCM material.  I would need a skilled seemstress to proto the modified PPE and testers to verify if the idea works.  It would seem it is easier to send these ideas to the PPE company that manufactures it so it can be incorporated into their designs.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Update10-9-14:\u00a0\n<br/>\n<em>Chimney effect cooler built into PPE:</em>\n<br/> One idea for a cheap and energy free solution for providing passive cooling to the care worker wearing PPE, the PPE could be modified to include tubular structures mounted to the back of PPE suit which have N99 filters on each side of the tube.\u00a0 The input tube will route near the back around the buttocks and the exit port would be by the back of the head.\u00a0 Due to the chimney effect as the body heats the air within the chimney tubes, the hot air will rise out and cold air near the bottom of the body will take its place.\u00a0 This effect will be minor but may be sufficient to drive enough airflow for the careworker to keep dry and cool.\u00a0 The tubular structures would be wide enough to allow sufficient space for the air to flow and be ridged enough such that the chimney is not kinked or obstructed when the careworker bends or turns.\n<br/>\n<br/> The chimney tubes could either be completely isolated from the body and mounted to the outside of PPE and have metal panels that conduct heat away from the body similar to a air-to-air heat exchanger (like wearing a backpack of metal tubes), OR the chimney tubes could have filters on each end to filter the air into the suit and then back out, the filters would restrict airflow but would allow humid air to escape.\n<br/> \u00a0 \n<hr/>\n<br/>\n<br/> A small and unexhaustive list of cooling technologies that can be worn:\n<br/>\n<br/> Active cooling:\n<br/> -Fluid that is chilled by an A/C that is pumped throughout tubing embedded into the clothing. \u00a0\n<br/> -Peltier device that contacts skin directly http://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/\n<br/>\n<br/> Passive cooling:\n<br/> -Ice packs / gel-packs that are pre-cooled in a freezer to be worn underneath or into PPE\n<br/> -Phase change material that is solid but absorbs heat from user and turns liquid\n<br/> -Evaporative cooling. (what if the PPE itself could sweat and cool off?)\n<br/> -Heat pipes\n<br/>\n<br/> Several products already exist that incorporate some of these technologies:\n<br/> http://www.activemsers.org/tipstricks/choosingacoolingvest.html\n<br/>\n<br/> These technologies could be built into PPE such as having a cooled liquid routed through its fabric or inside pockets that can store pre cooled ice-packs.\n<br/>\n<br/> One of my thoughts to incorporate a passive cooling technique into the PPE suit would include having a thermal conductive panel (such as an aluminum metal panel or thermal interface foam)\u00a0 in intimate contact with one of the warmest parts of the body (IE either the neck, the back/chest, armpits, or crotch) that is also able to conduct heat outside of the PPE.\u00a0 Think of it like a computer processor heatsink for the body.\u00a0 The thermal panels of the PPE would still maintain a water tight barrier from viruses but provide a thermal pathway for the heat to escape to the outside.\u00a0 To amplify the cooling effect through the thermal panels, one could actively cool this panel from the outside such as using evaporative cooling method and forced airflow or attaching a Peltier device to the thermal panel.\n        </div>",

  "summary": "The relief of stress and discomfort of wearing PPE in hot and humid conditions could be provided by either an active or passive cooling mechanism worn underneath or built into the PPE equipment.One simple passive cooling mechanism that could provide airflow essentially for free would be a chimney.  A chimney in PPE would be  tubing that routes through the back of the PPE suite which has filtered cold air intake and hot air exhaust near the shoulder area.  As the body heats up inside the PPE, the air in the chimney (tubing) will get warmer and naturally rise upward drawing in cooler outside air and exhausting warm humid air.",
