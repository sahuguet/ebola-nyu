  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            As the research phase has shown, the main problem preventing the containment of the virus is \n<strong>a cultural one</strong>:\n<br/>\n<br/> - Lack of general knowledge about the disease\n<br/> - Mistrust of the healthcare workers and of authorities\n<br/> - People hiding and being ashamed of the disease\n<br/> - Counterproductive habits like the ritual washing of the dead\n<br/> - A general difficulty for the government to communicate with citizens.\n<br/>\n<br/> So whom DO affected communities trust? Who will they listen to when given advice about how to prevent the disease?\n<br/>\n<br/> As in every community, in West Africa too there are \n<strong>influencers</strong>, which in most cases coincide with \n<strong>religious leaders, </strong>pastors and imams. A lot of them are already engaged in helping the disease's containment by talking and preaching to their communities (source:\u00a0http://www.dw.de/how-uganda-stopped-previous-ebola-outbreaks/a-17869469).\n<br/>\n<br/> More of them can be reached by radio, the most widespread media in the country, especially if:\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>insight 1: </strong>health-related messages are delivered \n<strong>together with target-relevant context,</strong> i.e., sermons, Quran readings, etc. But I guess that must be already done.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> But how do we reach communities who do not have radios? And how can we win the remaining skepticism and mistrust in health authorities?\n<br/>\n<br/> We have to give influencers \n<strong>a gift they cannot refuse</strong>, which will convince them of the importance of disease-prevention measures and actively help them spread the word.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> In a deeply religious society, that could be... \n<strong>a holy book.</strong>\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Just that these holy books will be special ones. In some of the books pages, \n<strong>disease-prevention measures</strong> will be printed. In the cover, an \n<strong>active GPS module</strong>, a tiny \n<strong>radio</strong> and a \u00a0will be placed. Finally, a sensor also placed in the cover will be able to count \n<strong>the number of times the book is opened</strong>, and- once a certain threshold is reach- push an alert to a server via the GPS.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> All of this should be quite inexpensive to produce and deliver. I would appreciate it \n<strong>if anyone on Open Ideo could help</strong> figure out what the exact cost for -say- 500k copies would be.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Governments and religious organizations</strong> could sponsor the distribution of Bibles and Qurans (they already do it on a massive scale: just think about the Gideons Bibles). Plus, distribution itself is not hard to do even in the remotest locations: the bibles could just be parachuted. \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> This will solve several issues:\n<br/> 1. The gift, given by religious people to religious people, \n<strong>will not be rejected</strong>.\n<br/> 2. If distributed on a large scale, the GPS module will enable- through statistical modelling- to \n<strong>track population movements</strong>, enabling the authorities to know\u00a0\n<br/> 3. Many times affected communities choose not to seek for medical help on cultural grounds. Thanks, again, to statistics, authorities will be able to intervene in a timely fashion despite this. Troubled communities and individuals tend to turn to religion. When \n<strong>many cover-openings</strong> will be detected within a small area, the authorities will know that there may be an epidemic in the area.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> Of course, all of this could easily and quickly be \n<strong> tested on a small scale</strong> and only then be fully implemented.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Addendum: should some communities be predominantly illiterate, the bible could be substituted by a saint's icon or a bismillah glyph.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Looking forward to hear your feedback!\n        </div>",
