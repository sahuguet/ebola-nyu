Thinking about a song (locally recorded) that could be played to promote the message might be a fast way to get it stuck in everyone's heads - and more likely to be followed!\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            The focus is to help encourage a simple and effective three step process that empowres people to aid in controling the spead. By keeping it to 3 steps people are able to internalize it and buy into it.\u00a0\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> The first two focus on the self and what people can do to keep themselevs healthy, which should have a mass appeal. People whould become viglient at washing hands consistantly throughout the day and anytime they make any kind of contact with another person. It is not a stigma response, but a part of daily life that everyone should be doing.\n<br/>\n<br/> The second is to aovid. This one should come failrly natural, but education would be required.\u00a0Avoid large publis places, close contact with others, any and all body fluids, etc.\n<br/>\n<br/> The last is to set up a reporting system. This has three componants. Report the self, if feeling ill, report when you see a family memeber ill, and report when you see a community being largely effected.\n<br/>\n<br/> If people simple follow these three steps or wash, avoid, and report as a cultural movement where everyone has a role to play, then it could slow down the spread and reduce stigma about the virus and patients. It becomes a source of national and community pride in that everyone is doing their part.\n<br/>\n<br/> This should be encouraged and promoted through media, school, public places, and treatment centers. \u00a0\n        </div>",
