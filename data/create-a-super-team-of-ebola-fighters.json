If something was attacking we'd round the troups and attack back.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "This is clearly a scare and a concern, governments and experts in the field should come together and make a super-team. Why not combine our efforts instead of running franticly? Locate already existing ebola victims (since they can't already get it again) in the area or city and create a team.The government in that area can connect them with medical supplies, proper learning/education of treatment and employment to further attack the spread.If these individuals become knowledgable, they can help treat the masses, and reduce the spread of individual contact.",
