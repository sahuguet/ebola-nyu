I think this is the missing link in much of the transmission given how little power women have in these countries over sex per my research in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n    "

You can find all of these stats (http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/) For Sierra Leone: Early initiation of breastfeeding (%), 2008-2012*44.6%Exclusive breastfeeding <6 months (%), 2008-2012*\u00a031.6%\u00a0But please see the following guidance: http://www.ennonline.net/operationalguidanceiycfv2.1 Formula is RARELY a good idea in these countries and it is UNICEF who should be involved in this so women who need supplemental feeding or even wet nurses can be followed. Bringing formula into a country that needs to breastfeed is deadly and not done. With one exception (Iraq) where breastfeeding rates were low. However, it was decided to leave the formula in the maternity supplemental feeding baskets because the women bartered or sold the formula for money (long story). \u00a0All of these countries have PEPFAR (http://www.pepfar.gov/countries/bilateral/) programs and funds; messages could be changed/modified.\n    "

I read some articles as I was researching for the Zero to Five which reported exclusive breastfeeding rates are low in Western Africa and that some mothers use water, juice, herbs to feed infants.  Seems that Unicef has multimedia breastfeeding campaigns that are helping to educate and there has been slow success.  I will check out PEPFAR.  Seems that ebola complicates the picture.\n    "

Your idea is very simple, but could be really effective, cheap and easy to produce in order to spread information to a large community. Leveraging a product and activity the community is already doing is great. Have you got  sketch or another image of what kind of information would be included on the sachets and how it might be presented? What kinds of things do you need from the community to help make this happen? A graphic designer? A healthcare expert? Feel free to add wants/needs/questions to your post using the update post button on the right :) Keep at it!\n    "

I also know sachet water from Ghana - a quick google search suggests it is common in Sierra Leone and Liberia as well, although it'd be helpful if someone with firsthand knowledge could comment. The only risk I could see is that people may hesitate to buy water with ebola symbols on it unless the messaging is extremely clear for all. Regardless, I think the idea of using existing supply chains that already reach remote areas to distribute information has huge potential.\n    "

I know one major water company in Guinea is called Coyah, though unfortunately I'm not sure the company has a website. This is a great start, though---I'd encourage you to keep up the search and finding other ideas-posters on the site who may have local on-the-ground contacts in either country. Perhaps reaching out to them would produce viable contacts.Great work and keep on keepin' on!H.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tCarolin, I think this is a great idea. One consideration that has arisen on my Idea is the use of local language/imagery for Ebola, to encourage care-seeking behaviour. In particular, I have found during my reading that naming the disease is sometimes thought to summon it. I think that working with local terminology and imagery (including those derived from magicoreligious traditions) could help to promote acceptance of educational materials. In the context of your Idea, using this kind of language and imagery on the water sachets could be a good step to enlisting users.  Bettina has mentioned that she will speak with members of the West African diaspora at her job site about the language of disease, which I think could provide some interesting results!\n    "

  "summary": "Sachet water is widely distributed and consumed in the affected regions, also in rural communities. Information about Ebola (symptoms, risks, to dos) could be printed on the bags to inform  in simple, catchy words and symbols.People who consumer sachet water are already aware of the need of clean water for their health.  So, there is an understanding of hygiene, and a level of trust in the product and its supplier.  This is an ideal starting point to raise awareness for ebola and encourage action in the case someone has symptoms or oberserves them at someone else.Water could also be given for free to communities to accelerate distribution. Also, other food products could be used, e.g. rice bags (or the local equalivant).",
