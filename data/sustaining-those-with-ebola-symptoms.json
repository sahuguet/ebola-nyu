  "summary": "Knowing that dehydration is a main reason why Ebola kills, I was thinking of a way to supply clean water to the Africans in remote villages with Ebola symptoms. I believe that WATERMELLONS are the answer! It may sound crazy, but just think about it: watermelons are 92% water, and naturally purify water as they take it in to grow. By eating watermelon, Ebola patients would be taking in five ounces of water per cup of fruit, as well as essential nutrients. In addition, the rinds can be buried and decomposed to enrich the earth. This is better than sending flats of plastic water bottles to Africa because Africa does not have recycling centers in rural areas, so the bottles would end up as waste in a landfill.",
