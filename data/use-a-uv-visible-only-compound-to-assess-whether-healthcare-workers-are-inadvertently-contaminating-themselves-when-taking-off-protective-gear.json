They could perhaps disrobe under UV light so they could see exactly at what spot the contamination occurs.  I think you could also douse a manikin to see where the contamination is usually picked up.  How expensive and hard to make is the SYBR Green?  Could it be sprayed on vomit before being cleaned up to provide a trace in real circumstances?\n    "

There's also a melamine bead suspension used in healthcare called GloGerm. I'll update the idea to reflect this. http://www.radpro.com/dye.pdf\n"

  "summary": "The idea is to use a UV visible-only, water-soluble compound, such as CalcoFluor or GloGerm, to assess whether healthcare workers are inadvertently contaminating themselves while putting on or taking off their clothing and performing tasks. Healthcare workers will douse their gloves in water containing this compound, perform required tasks, then take off their hazmat suit. After they have taken off their suit, a UV light will be turned on to evaluate whether they have inadvertently contaminated themselves or surfaces with this compound. This exercise will provide visual feedback on whether they are adhering to protocol and underscore how easy it is to contaminate surfaces.",
