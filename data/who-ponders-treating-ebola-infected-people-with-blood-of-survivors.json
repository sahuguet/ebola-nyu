You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

A\u00a0simple blood test could inform us of any agents that would harm someone. If a screening comes back clean, we take their blood for use in infected patients. If any dangerous substances are detected, we simply send the survivor on their way.\u00a0Doing this, we could prevent the possible\u00a0spread of harmful pathogens in our attempt to supply the survivors' antibodies to the infected patient.\u00a0\n        </div>",
