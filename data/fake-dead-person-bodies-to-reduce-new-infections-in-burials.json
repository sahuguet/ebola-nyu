Do you have any thoughts about how we might reflect the deceased's personalities to help the loved ones relate to this process if the actual body wasn't used in the ceremony? What about how the actual bodies are disposed of? Feel free to add questions or clarifications that you want from the community to your post so you can develop this idea further :)\n    "

I found this article where one person says:\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as Ebola. The government ordered doctors to inject sick people with a disease that makes them very weak, and then the doctors remove the patients\u2019 kidneys to sell for the government. Why do you think the hospital never returns the bodies to the families and buries them wrapped in plastic? So that no one will see that the body\u2019s kidneys had been removed.\u201dIt's a pretty tangled web over there.  I didn't know half of what this article talked about so it was pretty discouraging when I read it.  Maybe you'll be able to make some headway with it.http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/29/fighting-ebola-liberias-invisible-rebel/\n"
