  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n<strong>The background</strong>\n<br/> We spoke with MSF and they report us that the greatest emergency right now is the lack of people in the field and an organized structure to manage the treatment and to spot Ebola cases. In addition to the detection and lack of resources, another big issue is the huge amount of people affected which overload the health care system (ex. Monrovia - Liberia).\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The idea</strong>\n<br/> We decided to create a central operation service that manages and organizes the volunteers that are working in the field and examines patients in the region, plus educating victim\u2019s family and friends. Moreover, a home nursing system which provides a first care, in case of waiting list for the hospital.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> With our system everyone that decided to volunteer can become an effective operator in fighting the Ebola outbreak. The volunteer will receive an incentive to be part of the project and his profile will be rated based on his performance on the field (which will help to provide input the algorithm for prioritization).\n<br/>\n<br/> The Central Base of Operation would be able to detect case, respond with actions, understand the efficiency of the volunteers and the patient status, so promptly stop the outbreak of Ebola\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Our solution - The Emergency path</strong>\n<br/> (nursing, picking patient and corpses)\n<br/> Detection \u2013 database/prioritization \u2013 logistic support - home checking and education \u2013\u00a0 home nursing during the waiting list \u2013 patient picking up \u2013 deceased picking up.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Where we would like to focus</strong>\n<br/> - Home nursing for doctor, non-doctor\n<br/> - Database of Ebola cases\n<br/> - Database of volunteer efficiency (response rate and accuracy in response)\n<br/> - Patient prioritization and logistic\n<br/> - Corpse picking\n<br/> - Resource allocation\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>People involved</strong>\n<br/> Patients\n<br/> Doctors\n<br/> Volunteers\n<br/> Detector, Family members (creating ambassadors in the neighbourhood)\n<br/> Undertakers\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Different needs based on different circumstances</strong>\n<br/> - Differentiate Ebola cases from other diseases\n<br/> - Overloaded health switchboard\n<br/> - Overloaded health and holding centre\n<br/> - Treat patient at home\n<br/> - Not enough trained doctors\n<br/> - Lack of knowledge in Ebola treatments\n<br/> - Promptly detect and pick up bodies\n<br/> - Needs to understand where to send resources\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Software/Hardware</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Switchboard</strong>: automatic switchboard with Q&amp;A, direct answer form medical staff or text messages.\n<br/>\n<strong>Logistic support</strong>: Website, app, off line system or printable maps. Connected with hospitals availability, doctors and volunteer resources, patients, corpse picking teams and body signal.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<strong>Home checking</strong>: Text for confirming the Ebola case and fill in with additional information for prioritize the case (ESI Emergency Severity Index of Emergency Room).\n<br/>\n<strong>Home nursing</strong>: App, offline system, printed materials with information about how to nurse Ebola case, how to treat and precautions.\n<br/>\n<strong>Home nursing during the waiting list</strong>:\n<br/> Website, app, off line system, printable maps. For a routine nursing.\n<br/>\n<strong>Patient picking up</strong>: integrated database with continue monitoring on availability of space in Health Centre or Holding centres. Detected of the closest patient to the closest available centre.\n<br/>\n<strong>Corpse picking up</strong>: integrated database between hospitals, home care nursing, and live signals on corpse to pick up. Directly connected to the teams and a logistic support for an efficient pick up.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The System</strong>\n<br/> During the initial phase of our work, we aim with our software to obtain an accurate map of\u00a0the disease and to estimate its diffusion trend. We suppose very few data are available and\u00a0we don\u2019t take for granted any high profile specification such as GPS coordinates, images or\u00a0accurate diagnosis. These data will then be used on the second phase to coordinate the work\u00a0of high profile personnel such as doctors or undertakers.\n<br/> We think that the most convenient way to proceed is to refine a rough initial database with\u00a0consecutive steps. In our vision the work should be divided as follows.\n<br/>\n<br/> LOW LEVEL COMMUNICATION\n<br/> The main problem here are the means of communication, in a civilized modern world it\u00a0would be relatively easy to obtain large amounts of refined pieces of information, thanks\u00a0to the internet and smartphones. We must assume that only a very rudimental way of\u00a0communication is available in most of the places this disease is spreading. Even if our\u00a0software will cover all the most modern communication methods, it will require only a\u00a0telephone line.\n<br/>\n<br/> The main roles in this phase will be three:\n<br/>\n<br/> 1. The DETECTOR: The first who detects and is able to report a possible case of infection.\u00a0We can think about a family member, a friend or simply a fellow citizen. The detector is\u00a0uniquely identified by his telephone number.\n<br/>\n<br/> 2. The CERTIFIED OPERATOR is a person capable of certifying the actual state of the\u00a0patient. He will not be necessarily a doctor, but we suppose him to be more informed\u00a0than the standard citizen. He will have sufficient privileges to access the rough initial\u00a0database and to refine it certifying the actual existence of the patient and his vigour,\u00a0he will provide some initial, simple and objective diagnostics and he will certify the\u00a0eventual departure of the patient. Meanwhile he will provide to the surrounding\u00a0population the necessary instructions to interact with the patient and, when possible,\u00a0he will provide for free some necessary medical aids. Every certified operator must\u00a0be capable of communicating in a reasonable amount of time with the Central Base of\u00a0Operations, described below.\n<br/>\n<br/> 3. The CENTRAL BASE OF OPERATIONS (CBO) will be the place where all the logistics\u00a0will be arranged and toward which all the communications will be directed. It will\u00a0refine the pool of data using automated algorithms such as support vector machines,\u00a0which will guarantee the optimal estimate of each patient health status given the\u00a0pieces of information provided and continuously update it. It will automatically\u00a0connect to the most suitable certified operator for each case and finally it will\u00a0coordinate the medical personnel and the undertaker agencies for the most convenient\u00a0path to follow.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> The low level communication will happen as follows:\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/contribution/17002/202dc954-2bdb-40c3-8798-fce0235a369f.jpg\"/>This scheme will require only two contacts from the Detector (Request and Confirmation) and\u00a0just one operator to analyze the request, all the other processes will be automated.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> HOW IT WORKS:\n<br/> \u2022 REQUEST: The Detector contacts the CBO (calling or sending an SMS) with details\u00a0about the patient and himself, it is very important to obtain the detector\u2019s telephone\u00a0number which will be his unique identification number.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 The request is added to the initial rough database and automatically, relatively to the\u00a0geographic area of the request, all the certified operators in a reasonable distance\u00a0selected from a \u201cCertified Operators Database\u201d are alerted.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 AVAILABILITY: They are asked to guarantee their availability whenever confirmed.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 CHOICE: Our software will scan all the available operators and it will chose the most\u00a0suitable based on distance and reliability.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 OPTIMAL OPERATOR: The operator is engaged and waiting for detector's request\u00a0confirmation.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 CONFIRMATION REQUEST: The detector is contacted, he is informed about the\u00a0operator\u2019s availability and is asked for a request confirmation or eventual updates\u00a0about the patient.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 CONFIRMATION: If the request is confirmed, the optimal operator will automatically\u00a0be alerted. He will then reach the patient and update the database.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> HIGH LEVEL COMUNICATION\n<br/>\n<br/> At this point there have been at least three operations on the database: the patient addition,\u00a0the confirmation request which strengthen the real need for help and the operator\u2019s visit\u00a0which will add to each patient\u2019s description the objective evaluation of some features.\n<br/>\n<br/> The Certified Operator is a subject capable to provide in the worst case scenario the objective\u00a0diagnosis of simple symptoms and the accurate geographic position, in the best case scenario\u00a0instead the pieces of information could be very valuable, such as diagnostics, photos, GPS\u00a0\n<br/> coordinates.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Once the patient has been confirmed we can assume to have more refined data about each\u00a0case and most of all we can hope that most of the \u201cfalse positives\u201d in the first stage have been\u00a0identified and purged from the database.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Meanwhile an automated algorithm will evaluate the new data provided from the operators\u00a0to draft a ranking of the patients based on Ebola contamination probability and estimated\u00a0intervention effectiveness.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> We now are able to focus our attention where it is more probable for it to be effective. From\u00a0the database we can isolate the sites where Ebola is spreading and we can elaborate the most\u00a0convenient path, in terms of time and distances, for doctors and undertakers to follow to\u00a0reach and assist the infected people, or to treat the corpses in the safest way to protect the\u00a0surrounding living people.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> Built on:\n<br/> http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/scientists-print-ebola-test-tiny-bits-paper\n<br/>\n<br/> Source:\n<br/> https://news.vice.com/video/monrovia-in-chaos-the-fight-against-ebola-part-1\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
