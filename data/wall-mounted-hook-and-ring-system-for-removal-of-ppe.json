  "summary": "Credit to Anna Durbin who suggested one piece PPE suits with no gloves and Craig Provost suggested a pulling strip for safe removal of gloves. If both are put together with wall mounted hooks and rings on the suit then the wearer can just step back safely out of the suit without risk of contamination.Edit: On consideration maybe a floor mounted version would allow wearers to step out of the suit easier.Sorry about the picture lol..it's ms paint on a laptop.",
