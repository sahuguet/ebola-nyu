You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

      "message": "\n    \tThis suit is meant to be single use . Think of it in the same white material , the common material for normal single use coverall . Because Ebola is not airborne , I find no reason for filtered breathing . The head gear should be just a cheap plastic round hat , with the \u2018beekeeper\u2019 veil around , made of the same light , cheap material , or just a very dense cotton veil . Its purpose is to provide a personal space for the wearer to use his hands freely inside the suite for having a drink of water , or scratching face , smocking , or whatever, without touching hands whit the outside of the suite .  The expensive bits of the suit are the rubber boots , and the gloves , which must be glued somehow on the coverall , and must be thick and large for allowing of the hands to be taken out , at need , on the inside of the suit , something like an  electrician\u2019s gloves.The gloves and boots must be lined with cotton or something as it will be a great amount of perspiration in warm climates.  The suit must be cut large , to be loose enough to allow the wearer to have free arm movement inside it . This is not an isolation gear , it is a protective gear , light , cheap and single use , must be destroyed after every single use. It seems that everyone is keen on the complete isolation of the health care provider , but in the case of ebola I think that just very basic and simple rules of workplace hygiene should apply , with the stress on avoiding touching contaminated surfaces unprotected , and then touching oneself,  and carrying contaminated gear outside the isolation ward . Water , soap , chlorine , should be use for everything and by everyone leaving the isolation unit.\n    "

  "summary": "I started this with the purpose of adding a bit of practicality to the use of PPE kits used to protect the people involved in providing health services, or removing infected waste, in Ebola affected communities in Africa. \u00a0My idea is to adapt to the specifics of Africa, in particular to the need of a cheap but effective single use suite, usable in a warm and humid climate. This will suite not only to protect the wearer against Ebola but against any other non-airborne infectious agent. I took in to considerations the need to scratch ones face, to eat or drink, or to urinate without removing the protective gear for a number of several hours, as well as trying to eliminate the need of wearing plastic goggles or face mask .",
