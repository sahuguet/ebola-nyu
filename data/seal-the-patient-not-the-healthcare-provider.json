You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            What is needed is a modification of the sterile air tent\u00a0with inserts for special plastic gloves so that patients could be treated without anyone touching them. It would be somewhat like the sterile cocoon prepared for David Vetter but easier because there is no need for absolute sterility of everything entering the tent. Tents could be placed in mobile clean rooms that would assist in keeping the caregivers free from infections. Both would be easily transportable and capacity could be location specific. Transporting the patient into the air tent would still require protective gear but once inside, the patient would not come into direct contact with anyone. Soiled bedding, bandages, etc. could be removed directly into sealed containers. Tents would be single use but by patient rather than by health care worker encounter. Mobile clean rooms could be re-used if patients were bedded into the tent before entering the clean room. A sample of the sterile tent and mobile clean room can be found at www.airflowequipments.com/sterile-air-tents. \n<div>\n \u00a0\n</div>\n</div>",
