      "message": "\n    \tHi Monica, The skin needs to breathe so any membrane applied to the skin will hamper the ability of the body to thermoregulate particularly under a layered clothing system. The main function of the next to skin layer should be to thermoregulate not to act as an additional barrier to the disease (that is if the outer layer is doing its job).Health workers need to layer to achieve a better level of comfort as a single layer has too many compromises. A two layer system works best, with an outer protective layer to resist against the disease and an inner layer worn against the skin to buffer the body. You need air to circulate between the layers to move moisture and heat away from the body so you don't want the outer layer to be too tight. Wicking fabrics (with reference to Merrill above) only work if they are open to the atmosphere to allow evaporation to take place so they won't work in this situation in fact the synthetics will make workers sweat more ( boil in a plastic bag). In this situation synthetics do not actively manage moisture and will increase the wearers temperature while in comparison superfine wool can actively absorb up to 35% of its weight as moisture(sweat) without feeling wet against the skin. This works through a chemical reaction that absorbs both vapour and liquid perspiration. I suspect that an on-skin membrane would prevent effective thermoregulation. \u00a0In west Africa the biggest wearer discomfort being reported is thermal overload. The temperatures are hot and the suits are only a little breathable. If we can provide the aid workers with an effective outer barrier resisting the disease then the main function of the inner layer must be to manage their heat and sweat to keep the workers comfortable without being bulky and heavy. Take a read of these three science based fact sheets on the thermoregulation, moisture management and odour properties of wool to see how effective a fine-wool based next-to-skin garment system would be. Science provides us with the facts.Moisture management - http://lts.cr/Bg9fThermoregulation - http://lts.cr/Bg9POdour resistance - http://lts.cr/Bg9bRegardsAndy\n    "

      "message": "\nhttp://www.rubberizeit.com/so how about reversing the liquid membrane idea.  use the wicking layers and investigate cooling technologies.  Perhaps a liquid rubber can be applied over outer layer, making it completely water tight.  This can be adapted to the immediate existing and field improvised PPE out in the field.The one piece suit makes good sense but zippers provide problems.  how about an entirely different closing and sealing system.  Think double sided tape - peel and stick (a buddy would have to cut you loose!).....think food wrapping - automated.  how about a machine that wrap worker outer layer - and unwrap.Sounds silly - but look at weather proofing is done in buildings....flashing, counter flashing.....combine with self adhesive on (spray glues provide instant large contact surfaces.another.....with the walk in one piece over suits and sealed from the back....how about a type of walk in vacuum cubicle to assist with removing and disinfecting or disposing.....outer layer sucked off  as it has water tight surface....allow for air to enter and it should separate from permeable inner super engineered cooling fabrics.pardon the \"all over place thoughts\" but had to get it out on the run.\n    "

Our skin is our most sensory organ and if we can buffer it from heat and cold we can increase the wearers comfort. Wicking garments ( synthetics) do not work under layered systems because they require evaporation to move moisture away from the body. Our garment system delays the onset of sweat and ,the fabric can hold up to 35% of its weight with sweat aiding towards keeping a more stable body temperature.Take a look at https://letscrate.com/c/40oE for the science.Regards Andy\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi everyone-I like the idea as far as next to cloths wicking and all-but your assuming that the providers gets in and stays in the suit-unfortunately thats not always the case, That is the safest way to do it. So people that handle the waste and doing the dirty jobs are probably the best protected. The people that are most at risk are the providers that go in and out of the room. The problem is the PPE itself-its too complicated-too many parts-and its poor design. Whats needed is a single piece unit-one on-one off, the idea is reduce the number of times that someone has to expose themselves-so headgear and gloves are all part of one system. Its taking it all off that the problems occur-so cut the number to one or 2 and reduce the risk.  What we are doing is a poor design-it wasnt made to do the job-so lets come up with a design that is. Or we stay the course and we are still going to have people killed\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi William.  I posted this IDEA specifically to get a conversation going around PPE - improving it's design.  Another huge issue is the heat.  The current suits are very hot.  Combining this with the climate apparently workers stay in the suits for an average of 40 minutes.  So yes they have to get in and out of suits very often.  The product that Andy has proposed apparently will help keep one's body temp regulated and perhaps using this layer will decrease discomfort using the current suit.  I don't have the answer but I think it is an idea worth testing.So the problem with dressing and suiting up can be approached from several angles.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Bettina-heres the problem -we have 2 different populations -those that are in the gear for long periods of time-like the waste disposal or those doing body recovery-they can get in the suit and stay in all day. The suits that have all the bells and whistles, wick dry and cooling is great. But the people at most risk are those that see other patients-that have to change frequently-and thats the problem. We need a heavy duty suit that can be reused by different providers-that saves money and time, but dont have to worry about exiting without killing themselves in the process, like to bubble suit. Or we need a suit that light and comfortable -made of paper or similar-thats easy to get in and out, gloves and face protection all come off in one unit.Ill bet my paycheck that the people get contaminated by either the mask-face shield or gloves. so why cant we make that one piece for both. Ill bet that if you make a single piece suit-that covers head to toe-that can remain loose-the comfort factor goes up, reducing the heat, and able to get more done.Also need to keep in mind that patients dont just lay there , sometimes you need to turn them-or get them back to bed, so the possibility of getting anywhere on the body is a potential, we concentrate on just chest level in front-but there is so much more thats possible, ever have someone vomit on you-yea a mess, and its all over-current isolation gowns in the hospital doesnt cover all that, its a gown that goes below knees, so how do you protect from that ?Thats why I say cover head to toe-shoes, head,gloves and all, entry from the back-no hands used to exit, slide in-slide out, unit goes right to trash-no hands touch to place it there if possible-the trash.The trick is how to keep cool, and keep facemask from fogging-best thing Ive seen is just having some space-so no form fitting-nothing close to face-but everything that comes in-air is filetered in some way-worse case is the HIPPA filter mask that has valves-it at least takes the cool air to the face and prevents the warm air-exhalation from staying next to you.I hope to talk to some people here about ideas, materials and technique-but open to suggestions. No matter what-we need something easy and quick, literally lives are at stake.\n    "
