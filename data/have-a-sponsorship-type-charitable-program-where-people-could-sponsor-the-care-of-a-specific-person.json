      "message": "\n    \tright. --google (& ubuntu?) has good systems for this such as the ones used during emergencies to find loved ones--and connecting the well with the ill both morally & financially is positive synergy. This was similarly done during the Vietnam War where individuals purchased metal bracelets with the names of POW/MIAs. They wore them until the person was found and freed when the metal bracelet was broken off. The purchase of the bracelet raised funds & the efforts became more meaningful by linking individuals.\n    "

  "summary": "Some charitable programs have donors sponsor a specific individual.  The idea would be to have a  web sight with living infected people requiring treatment and whose treatment could be sponsored.Individuals could contribute financially to their care until the average per capita cost was collected.  Donors would be informed of the outcome of the patient they sponsored and the patient would be notified of their sponsors.The idea is that each fully sponsored  treatment means one less person will be sent home.  The money would be invested in building additional capacity, hiring staff, and purchasing supplies.",
