      "message": "\n    \tThere are basic sanitization sprays or sanitizing liquids that could clean the surfaces that the user would come in contact with. Simple hand sanitizer type of dispensers could be retrofitted into the restroom and allow users to wipe down surfaces that they touch (ex. toilet seat, faucets and door knobs). This could be a low cost and efficient way to achieve similar results if the time constraints of having the bathroom out of service for an hour during or between flights is not be feasible. These sanitizers can also be carried by the user and are small enough to fit in a pocket or purse. Check with the air line's regulations before doing so of course. Products like these are an easy way to protect yourself from many illnesses and are often overlooked precautions. Hand washing is not effective if the user touches the door knob to exit the restroom.

With respect to EBOLA, trained health care professionals are catching the virus even when outfitted with protective gear. I can't imagine it would be a good idea to try to wipe down an airplane bathroom with a 2 oz bottle of hand sanitizer, turbulence, and a tissue.\n    "
