You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            The problems that require solution are to reduce the number of locations where infected contaminates can penetrate, make dress and undress simpler, keep the care giver cooler to reduce sweating in a hot climate, and provide positive pressure airflow to insure that air currents cannot suck contaminants in through gaps when the person moves about.\u00a0\n<br/> The best solution is a one piece bunny suit including head cover and transparent face mask.\u00a0 Surgical gloves are the only addition to the coverage, to retain dexterity and sensation.\u00a0 Similar protective suits are now used for chemical hazmat purposes.\u00a0 Add to this suit continuous positive pressure irrigation of the suit, to keep the user comfortable in a hot climate, prevent sweating, and prevent fogging of the face mask.\u00a0 Add hepa filtration of the irrigation air to remove any particulates which may carry infection.\u00a0 The air system will include an intake tube bringing cool filtered air through the umbilical tube to the suit, and an exit tube to exhaust warm humid air from the suit.\u00a0 A pressure relief valve on the exit air will dump the slightly higher pressure air from the suit to the outside air.\u00a0 Thus, the pressure in the suit will not be able to rise above the desired pressure.\u00a0 It is also possible to measure the airflow coming in and the airflow going out to detect the amount of leakage in the suit.\u00a0 If it is too great, an alarm is sounded to inform the user that there may be a tear or breach in the suit.\u00a0 The umbilical may\u00a0incorporate a \"Y\" connector to allow the connection of a secondary\u00a0air\u00a0pump or a battery powered hepa filtered portable unit which can be worn by the user during movement into or out of the patient quarters.\u00a0 Electronics may also be incorporated into the umbilical to power a head lamp or audiovisual equipment.\u00a0 The user may also wear a Bluetooth earpiece to improve communication, and use a smartphone with voice entry to record and communciate with others at a distance.\n<br/> The result will be a protective suit which is much\u00a0faster to don and remove, and has less likelihood of introduction of contaminants through\u00a0gaps.\u00a0 If an air cooler is provided, the user will be much more comfortable and able to work longer shifts.\u00a0 The fraction of time required to don and remove the\u00a0protective gear\u00a0and to decontaminate it upon removal will be\u00a0much\u00a0less.\u00a0 And, the cost of the one piece bunny suit will probably\u00a0not be more than the present method.\u00a0 The air pump will not be contaminated because of the hepa filter, and the contaminated filter will be inexpensive and easy to change.\u00a0 The hose can be disposable and the pump located outside the patient quarters iif desired.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "The PPE used today is a kluge of assorted items, providing lots of opportunities for contamination during wear and the added risk of contamination during undress.The proposed idea is to approach the problem differently by using a one piece bunny suit which stays slightly inflated during use by introduction of hepa filtered cool air.  The cool air is introduced by an umbilical tube from a separate pump with hepa filter to remove all particulates.   The hose can also be attached to a battery powered small pump without refrigeration for temporary use to permit mobility out of the patient quarters.  The change from stationary pump to battery pump or back can be done by a \"hot swap\" without loss of positive pressure to prevent contamination.",
