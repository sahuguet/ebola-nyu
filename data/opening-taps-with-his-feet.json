My suggestion is that the tap was opened with activation done by foot. Thus, people who were in contact with infected persons, can use the water during the process of removal of PPE without putting themselves at risk.\u00a0This type of equipment supplied is available in the market with a low price, we can also improvise low cost solutions.\n        </div>",
