The hotter the temperature the more power which would be ideal for warm climes.\n<br/>\n<br/> http://www.technologyreview.com/view/427140/graphene-battery-turns-ambient-heat-into-electric-current/\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Unlike plastic which insulates, graphene can potentially absorb unlimited amounts of heat. Graphene can generate electric power from ambient heat such as the heat inside a ppe suit which opens the door for self powered cooling suits. Full suits may be made from graphene.An Irish lab found a way to mass produce graphene.Again, all input by fellow members is greatly appreciated and welcomed. Feel free to comment and speculate, whether positive or negative - it's all helpful",
