How could you use these strategically to support getting the suits on and off quickly and safely?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tInteresting point, could we incorporate something into the design of the suits that can seal where they gloves meet the arms, could we combine a zip/ seal similar to the freezer bags? something as you twist ensures you cover the gap 360? Was also thinking before I seen this post of something similar around the facemask/goggles, looking at some off them they look quite awkward with the goggles been separate...could something be put together similar to a beekeeper suit? with the goggles as part of the hood?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tProblem with elastic bands is that they can cut into the wearers circulation, anything less presents a weak boundary seal & as the wearer moves it creates a potential failure  - due to possibility of stretching beyond the sealed zone.  Solutions have been found for air & liquid tight seals in space suits and deep sea dive suits, while such suits are expensive, the basic seals could be made in plastic with replaceable gloves and hoods attached by stretch fit material.  Basically two interlocking rings twist fitted together to make an interlocked seal - an extension of the zip lock bag idea, but more robust, and re-useable.   Such seals could be made in a standardised size.  Even if a stretchable suit material isn't practical, duct tape sealing the rings to the standard material still allows for easy removal of the PPE.  More of a long term solution for future suits..\n    "
