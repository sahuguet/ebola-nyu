It will have what we already know about Ebola and will be updated as the known information is updated. I think it will suceed because people want to know what's going on and social meadia is really popular now a days so by spreading it through facebook I think people will definitly be inrested in seeing what it's about and will help support this.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "What's Ebola? Asking that same question? We'll here's your answer, I say we make a Facebook page. With that, we'd post all the information about Ebola we have right now and keep updating it for people. It's a good way to look for way to help educate people and have  a common place in which to do this. Not only that, but if you have a question about Ebola and we look through the Facebook page and see some information on it but that doesn't answer your question then you can leave a comment or add a post. This is made to help inform those people who are afraid to be less afraid and to help understand what this is.",
