  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Dear Sir/Madam,\n<br/>\n<br/> I am drug discovery/reprofiling consultant. I have traced out novel FDA approved drugs as the treatment option/proposal for Ebola virus patients. If you are interested then I will need just your surety to maintain the confidentiality (I am not asking for NDA due to critical stage and time issue). I hope you would be able to bother my words. 2 FDA approved drugs would be used in medium dose for treatment of Ebola. In my proposal, lamivudine or any experimental drugs for Ebola are not included.\n<br/>\n<br/> Looking forward for your response.\n<br/>\n<br/> Kind regards\n<br/>\n<br/> Dr. Farhan Ul Haq Subhani (M.B.,B.S)\n<br/> Independent Drug Discovery/Reprofiling Consultant\n<br/> email: farhan2alzheimer@yahoo.com\n<br/> LAHORE PAKISTAN\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
