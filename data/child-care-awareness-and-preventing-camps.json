I read from the news that most of them are on the streets or taken care by their  neighbours .The thing is to design the \"organization\" and I do believe its so hard to do it fro here without  any field knowledge and the systems established there.\n    "

The question you both have in common is how can we empower children to reduce the spread of Ebola, not only amongst themselves, but as a resource to educate adults as well. Check Nick's post out here - https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/research/what-we-learned-from-anti-smoking-target-kids-to-affect-adults What kind of questions would you like to ask the community to help you develop this idea or advance it's ability to be implemented? Feel free to update your post with needs/questions for the community :)\n    "

This is part of a broader, six-month appeal for $987.8 million that governments and humanitarian agencies require to fight the disease.\u201cEbola is killing people and undermining futures,\u201d said Afshan Khan, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes. \u201cIt is closing schools, destroying health systems and threatening the very fabric of communities. This is a crisis of enormous proportions.\u201d  Of the $200 million, nearly $65 million will go to UNICEF\u2019s programmes in Liberia, around $61 million to Sierra Leone and more than $55 million to Guinea. An additional $10 million will help neighbouring countries be prepared for a potential spread of the disease within their borders. The remaining $9 million are required for regional coordination efforts.UNICEF estimates that 8.5 million children and young people under the age of 20 live in areas affected by Ebola in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Of these, 2.5 million are under the age of five.From working with communities to raise awareness of the disease and providing essential hygiene supplies since the first days of the outbreak, UNICEF has stepped up its response as Ebola continues its deadly spiral. The children\u2019s agency, present in all affected countries, has been rushing in essential supplies and providing life-saving information in the heart of affected communities on how families can protect themselves.Examples of such effort by UNICEF and its partners include:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With support from the World Bank, Japan and USAID, airlifting 544 metric tonnes of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with almost 50 flights since early August. These supplies include protective equipment, hygiene items and essential medicines.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supporting the Government of Sierra Leone in conducting a three-day public awareness campaign, 19-21 September, by helping train volunteers and providing accurate information on Ebola.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Installing water and sanitation facilities in Ebola treatment units in the three countries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Training community health volunteers, teachers and others and help spread life-saving information on Ebola.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Working to avert non-Ebola disease outbreaks and provide basic services to women and children.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Providing psychosocial support to children affected by Ebola.\u201cWe need to work with communities,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe can save lives now if every country, every agency that has the means to support, does so.\u201d\n    "

I do believe it would be perfect for this company to join forces to the fight of ebola as they have already produced the perfect -match product which is a dominant need...https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6226/6285831678_64a8599e3f_z.jpg\n"

Children get together at the streets, touch themselves, play together, share food and don't help their hygiene; which makes the work harder for the officials.\n<br/> http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/02/health/ebola-outbreak/\n        </div>",

They don't wash hands, and don't take care of hygiene conditions as they are only children...There are also great amount of child being left alone because of their parents are diseased or dead reported.  I believe  that building and operating  camp fields for children would be helpful for preventing the disease to spread without conscious.. would help the orphans and homeless children and of course would improve their social, emotional status; as well as it would create awareness for the future generations.",
