\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Suggestions:\n<br/>\n<br/> 1.)\u00a0 Suggestion to improve Personal Protective Equipment by creating containment suits with only one opening.So, instead of \u2018openings\u2019 at sleeves and ends of pants, the worker is contained inside the suit with only the zipper and face area \u2018open\u2019.The worker peels off the containment suit like a banana peel and steps out of it and eliminates further contamination possibilities which result from handling areas around wrists and ankles.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0 a.\u00a0 Attach latex gloves using either a heat seal or glue and ensure a perfect seal.\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0b.\u00a0 Include feet when making the suits.Create the suits in a similar design as children\u2019s sleepers that have the feet included and just one zipper in the front-center of the suit.\n<br/> \u00a0 c.\u00a0 Include a Snap flap over zipper opening.\n<br/> \u00a0 d.\u00a0 Include a clear plastic shield to cover the face and attach it to the hood.The hood has an elastic opening around the face.\n<br/>\n<br/> Separate pieces would include:\u00a0 the outer pair of heavier gloves, rubber boots and mask.\u00a0\n<br/> Healthcare Professionals (HCP) in contact with victims should have total containment suits that enclose head and no visible skin.\u00a0 Separate pieces would also include a breathing apparatus with filter.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 2.\u00a0 Use adult diapers to prevent emergency situations where healthcare workers could potentially create errors if rushing to remove their containment suits.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 3.\u00a0 Rinse scrubs in cool water and wring out before donning containment suits if working in tropical heat.The cool, damp fabric will help cool core body temperature.The damp, cool scrubs can be immediately implemented in the field.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 4.)\u00a0 Create cooling vests with thin pads of lightweight gel that are refrigerated before wearing.Or else refrigerate the entire vest.The vest is made of lightweight cotton with pockets to hold light, thin gel packs that keep the body core cool.\n<br/>\n<br/> Training suggestions:\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 5.)\u00a0 Suggest training include simulated scenarios that would allow Healthcare workers to see possible contamination of Ebola fluids with the use of colored fluids and UV/Black light.Recommend 2 phases of training which use simulated body fluids.So, 1st phase, use colored liquids that actually show up on the trainee \u2013 on their gloves, boots, uniforms, etc.So, that they can see how and where it\u2019s possible when fluids \u2018travel\u2019.Recommend using actors or dummies that simulate bodily fluids on the floor, bedding, and body.The workers perform their usual tasks and check if any resulting fluids show up on the bottom of boots that track into clean changing areas, on gloves that end up touching inner surfaces when taking off suits, etc.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 6.)\u00a0 The 2nd phase would use the same technique but with invisible fluids that show up with UV/black light in simulated real-life training.The clear phosphorous or florescent liquids would be smeared on actors or dummies to simulate if they have projectile vomit, explosive diarrhea, bowel movements, urine, saliva, blood, etc., on patients, bedding and floors, etc. and would show workers how difficult it can be to detect or see it when it\u2019s not readily visible. Include \u2018exploding\u2019 liquid into the air, so that droplets are sprayed onto the worker.These scenarios will help prevent infection from \u2018invisible\u2019 but deadly contamination possibilities.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 7.)\u00a0 Another option is to use a fine powder for both scenarios.\u00a0 Utilizing a fine colored powder that allows trainees to immediately see where they could unintentionally contaminate themselves and others.\u00a0 Utilize an \u2018invisible\u2019 powder with UV lights.\u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 8.)\u00a0 Use a military army style of basic training to train in the wearing of containment suits.Emphasize the similarity to training soldiers; that they must learn correct procedures and processes because knowing the correct process and doing it correctly is the difference between preventing self from being killed and preventing battle buddies from being killed from mistakes and/or carelessness.It\u2019s better to have a few workers who are careful and cautious than many workers where one worker ends up infecting all of the rest of the workers and thereby have NO workers then, to help patients.Also, the repetition of training in the correct procedure for donning and removing the PPE will help with muscle memory.Especially when HCP are tired, weary and distracted with Ebola cases/victims but still retain and maintain proper procedures.\n<br/>\n<br/> Care Setting Suggestions:\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0\n<br/> 9.)\u00a0 Use UV Black lights in Ebola isolation unit changing areas to detect Ebola bodily fluids on suits, boots, workers, etc.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 10.)\u00a0 Create two distinct zones in the changing rooms.Use colored tape or paint to clearly delineate two zones in the room.Create an incoming zone and an outgoing zone with a basin of disinfectant immediately at door, so that boots are immediately disinfected before stepping further into the changing room.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 10.)\u00a0 Utilize a military hierarchy with the \u2018army\u2019 of incoming Healthcare Professional volunteers from the United States and Liberian Healthcare workers.The hierarchy will help with assigning units to different locations, oversight/management and reporting.\n<br/>\n<br/> Healthcare worker tools Suggestions:\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 11.)\u00a0 Provide personal UV/Blacklight flashlights to healthcare workers to check any area, their containment suits and themselves.A Rayovac UV/blacklight flashlight cost is roughly $10 and is relatively inexpensive but very easy to use and deploy.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> Community Culture and Communication Suggestions:\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 12.)\u00a0 Liberian cultural practice of mourning loss of loved ones with funerals is replaced with cremating Ebola victims and therefore has removed an outlet of grieving for loved ones.Provide an alternative way of mourning the loved ones.When a person no longer has a familiar, known way of expressing their grief and displaying their outpouring of their emotion, then their grief is that much more difficult for them to bear.They are not only dealing with their grief but also the removal of a practice that provides familiarity and comfort to the bereaved.The practice of lovingly dressing their deceased loved one\u2019s body, staying up all night with the body and then gathering together with family and community for a funeral \u2013 now leaves them with none of those familiar rites to help them let go of their loved one.The rites are more a way for the bereaved to feel that they\u2019re expressing their love and devotion for their loved one.Therefore, provide replacements for those rites that will allow them to express themselves and show their devotion and grief.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0 a.\u00a0 Liberian burial practices include sitting with the corpse all night. Work with religious leaders to suggest a night of prayer for the loved one and their family instead, since bodies must be cremated immediately.\n<br/> \u00a0 b.\u00a0 Offer to take a video or digital picture of the dead body and print out a picture for the family.A picture might help provide closure since families are not able to say goodbye to the body or bury it.\n<br/> \u00a0 c.\u00a0 The family could order a funeral frame from the local coffin maker and create a memorial service around the picture which again, provides a replacement outlet for an actual coffin and funeral.\n<br/> \u00a0 d.\u00a0 Emphasize that family and victims should express sympathy for one another through gestures of symbolic hugging, kisses, etc., but not touch one another.\n<br/> \u00a0 e. Allow family members to give small token to be cremated with the body.Eg, a cross, a picture, etc.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> 13.)\u00a0 Media/PR campaign with President Johnson Sirleaf and Liberian celebrities regarding Ebola information.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> Ask Liberian celebrities to help emphasize importance of quarantine, hand-washing and no touching, reporting Ebola and Ebola contact, etc.\n<br/> Ask Liberian celebrities to help promote truth that those who help fight Ebola are national heroes.Ebola fighters/health care workers are fighting against Ebola War and are helping save their nation.They are worthy of praise, respect and admiration by their nation and fellow countrymen.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> 14.)\u00a0 Ensure that Liberians are not misled by deliberate misinformation from terrorist/jihadist groups regarding the increased number of Ebola cases and ensure it\u2019s NOT portrayed as the result of sudden influx of Western aid.The Ebola cases are exponentially multiplying.Unfortunately, the RESULT will become apparent just about the same time that Westerners start arriving in large groups to assist Western Africa.It would be easy for terrorists to attempt to lie and deceive in propaganda attempt and claim that Westerners are the cause of the increase and/or behind it.Since the two events will coincide, then Western Africa and Western allies will need to ensure good education and good communication about the timing of suddenly having large number of Ebola victims while at the same time also having a large number of Westerners arriving to help.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 15.)\u00a0 Provide \u2018twin\u2019 stuffed animals to children with Ebola.One stuffed animal is for use while in quarantine and will have to be burned after child recovers.The second stuffed animal is given to the child upon recovery.The stuffed animal will help provide the child some comfort while sick.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> 16.)\u00a0 Allow the children to watch/see from either video or from a distance, how a worker dons the \u2018scary alien\u2019 PPE containment suit so that the child is able to understand that it\u2019s not a \u2018monster\u2019 in the containment suit.The pediatric Healthcare professionals wear scrubs with patterns of cute pandas, puppies, etc. to help children feel at ease.So, if possible, add kid-friendly patterned apron or wear a pediatric designed scrub shirt on the outside of the suit.\n<br/> \u00a0\n<br/> Please see attached PDF\n        </div>",
