  "summary": "Should I be worried about ebola or not?This is the question we've been recently asking ourselves.The amount of information on the internet about the virus grows at an incredible rate. This is mainly because there is a general need from the desperate media to get users reading articles and watching videos that in many situations don't carry accurate information. This is a big problem!!I think a trusted media institutions should join efforts with medical institutions to  build a digital/print/ATL (as many mediums as possible)strategy to curate and filter information. The objective would be to increase knowledge, to empower people by giving them accurate information.",
