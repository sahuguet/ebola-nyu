You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

      "message": "\n    \tIt's a good idea Frank, I like it. It would suit temporary hospitals perfect. The only issue I can see would possibly be the limitation of movement due to hoses but it might be countered if the hoses are suspended from the ceiling and could be removed and reattached at different areas, possibly one beside each bed.  (Hoses stem from a single refrigeration unit )\n    "

This will reduce the likelhood that contamination will be spread through gaps in the enclosure.\u00a0 The pumping apparatus will be outside the controlled environment.\u00a0 A\u00a0hepa filter to filter the air removed from the controlled environment will be installed at the end of hose which is inserted through a port in the wall.\u00a0 When it is to be changed, the hose segment leading to the\u00a0controlled environment will be detached from the pump and withdrawn into the environment, and then disposed of with the other contaminated materials inside. A new hose with filter at the distal end will then be inserted through the port and into the controlled environment.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Use an ordinary kitchen refrigerator or a bucket of ice  to chill the air which will be then filtered by a hepa filter and sent to the suit.  This keeps the apparatus for filtering, pumping, and chilling the air outside the patient treatment area, and reduces the cost of the suit and its supporting apparatus as low as possible.  One cooing apparatus might supply multiple positive pressure bunny suits and also permit a \"hot swap\" of source air to a battery powered unit carried by the suited up person to facilitate movement of medical personnel.",
