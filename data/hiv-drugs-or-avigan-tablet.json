CowanI am personally very impressed with a man who stands in harm\u2019s way willing to try something anything that might work, even if he fails. My concern is not whether Dr. Logan concept is right or wrong but that it gets a fair and full experimental testing, too much at stack not to.\u00a0Below is information that might be helpful to Dr. Logan and associates.\u00a0Immunity is the cornerstone of Ebola symptoms and lethality. Ebola viral proteins turn off key components of the immune response allowing a foot in the door for viral infection and replication, vast amounts of viral products and associated cell death cause a immune overreaction an inflammatory \"cytokine storm\" that greatly contribute to the pathology, symptoms and lethality of Ebola. The balance of pathological and protective immunity can mean life or death.\u00a0Lamivudine so far has shown no anti-viral activity against Ebola. Lamivudine's possible efficacy against Ebola, should consider not just the front door anti-viral but back door ant-inflammatory, and even side-doors of other possible pharmacology. Our group (see cite below) for example previous points out many drugs have secondary anti-inflammatory pharmacology that might have efficacy for inflammatory pathology caused by both chemical agents and infectious agents such as Ebola.\u00a0Related work\u00a0;\u00a0Cowan FM, Broomfield CA, Stojiljkovic MP and Smith WJ.

  "summary": "Dr. Gorbee Logan has given the drug, lamivudine, to 15 Ebola patients, and all but two survived. That's about a 13% mortality rate. Across West Africa, the virus has killed 70% of its victims. \"I'm sure that when [patients] present early, this medicine can help,\" Logan said. \"I've proven it right in my center. If someone with symptoms thinks they can be cured maybe, they would seek help faster. These drugs should be made available right away.  http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/27/health/ebola-hiv-drug/",
