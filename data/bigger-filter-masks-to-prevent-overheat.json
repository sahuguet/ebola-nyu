You are absolutely right to focus on getting rid of hot gas - I wouldn't be surprised if that is the most irritating part of being suited up.\n    "

  "summary": "Thanks to William Rasmussen and Rik Ganju for both thread and comments.Apologies for the medieval photo of the black plague mask but it was to emphasize a point.  Have you ever worked in a dust mask for any length of time?  You overheat in seconds due to the buildup of co2 and poor gas exchange. Couple this with plastic ppe suits in tropical climates and it's life threatening.   In the absence of proper respirators - longer masks with more surface area are needed to keep workers cool.",
