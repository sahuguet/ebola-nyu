      "message": "\n    \tI applauded that Rainer, believe it or not I had sketched the same idea this morn - plastic ribs to act as spacers over the shoulders and back which would allow your fan/vent idea to work.  I've also wondered would a long trench coat type ppe with open bottom work - seeing as Ebola is not airborne.. Much of the heat would drop out the bottom.\n    "

  "summary": "Air has a low heat conductivity.  It is known from windows with two glass plates, that the distance between them should not exceed a certain distance. With a higher distance convection starts and the heat transmissions resistance is reduced.Whenever it is not possible or not required to have a low distance between the PPE and skin or clothing, spacers should be added, so that the distance is so high, that convection inside the PPE starts.",
