      "message": "\n    \tYou must be able to browse the web and yes this is probably more likely for monitoring in developed countries.  Because Zoom installs so easily (it is an app for the phone/tablets) it is just much easier for someone who hasn't used video conferencing before and requires almost zero technical knowledge.  I'm thinking more for monitoring of people returning from volunteering.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            How those in quarentine or self-check are being monitored is being left up to individual states etc. \u00a0Some people are just logging in and posting without any face to face chat. \u00a0For some at high risk that might not be enough and so people have been suggesting skype, google chat, and other video apps.\n<br/>\n<br/> I'm suggesting using www.zoom.us as the easiest from the patients' perpespective. \u00a0I like simple interfaces without a ton of confusing bells and whistles and Zoom is the simplest and the easiest to install of all that I've tested. \u00a0You go to a web page (which a link to can be given in an email) put in a code that the owner of your meeting has given you and within seconds you can be in face to face contact.\n<br/>\n<br/> And\n<br/>\n<br/> It works with iphone and android as well as PCs. \u00a0They even already have been working with healthcare on telemedicine so it's just the state people who need to be informed that they don't have to go out and get a fancy bells and whistles video conferencing which cost hundreds of dollars a month.\n<br/>\n<br/> Price? \u00a0 Free for up to 25 people at a time. \u00a0 Yes that is FREE\n        </div>",
