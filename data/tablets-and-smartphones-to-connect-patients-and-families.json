      "message": "\n    \tHi Nick, great contribution. Have you thought about sanitization of these devices that come into contact with the patients and or care workers? These are still fairly expensive devices that most likely aren't readily available in some communities - how can we rotate a central unit in a sanitary way to avoid cross contamination? What other kind of support might we leverage this technology for?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tMakes me wonder though if we need to stop at emotional support...Could using tablet-based webcams allow HCWs to limit their rounds inside of quarantine areas, and by extension, their personal exposure risk? Sort of similar to robotics that are already being used in some American hospitals (http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/Robot-for-hospitals.png). Could ebola survivors be the \"legs\" for a physician connected by wifi-connected tablet?Taken to the extreme, I wonder if telemedicine connectivity would allow more international HCWs to give care and increase the bandwidth of local health centers without increasing exposure risk.\n    "
