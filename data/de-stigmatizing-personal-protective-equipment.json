I think a PPE that turns the careworker into a famous character that local culture would be familiar with would be quite effective as people in costume typically attract a crowd instead of repel.\n    "

This \"animal\" or form could be put on a potential suspected Ebola patient, that would give the care giver an indication of the physical and emotional state of the patent giving the care giver a greater indication of how to respond to the patient enhancing the personal experience and aiding in faster recovery. This allows for a new kind of \"Touch\" without touching which could be dangerous and spread the decease.\n    "

Probably a color more like yellow in the inside as in an above comment would have the same effect to monitor (gosh, I hope not!) breaches.\n    "

But something other than ghostly white or hazard yellow should be investigated, along with the overall construction of the PPE equipment - again, as it relates or impacts the field (outside) and/or hospital (inside) environments.  I think manufacturers may have a list of what works and what doesn't...\n    "

The masked appearance is scary, the capacity to see warmth in a human face, a smile that conveys caring as well as eyes that reassure can't be overstated - especially when dealing with children. I think the hardest thing about these suits is how it separates us from connecting in a human way.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tI like your idea Sean.  You might also be able to incorporate color coding, or markings for health care workers in terms of de gowning as well.  When a worker takes the PPE off it is essential to only touch the inside, the non contaminated part.  The same for the gloves.   When one is tired sometimes mistakes are made.  From what I have read workers are extremely hot and sweaty due to the climate and the gear - add to that overwork and psychological stress - a set up for possible errors in removing the clothing.  Can color markings on the interior aspects help?  Something like this?\n    "

Red should be avoided since it signifies anger, aggression, and in the particular case of Ebola, blood. These are all stigmatizing impulses and may become counterproductive to health workers. If the visual message is \"We're here to help\" with soothing colors and a clear icon, acceptance of help may increase in the most affected areas.",
