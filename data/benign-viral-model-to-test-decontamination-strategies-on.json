You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Effective methods for killing EV on skin, tools, furniture, or clothing are needed. I proposed a UV LED array, but efficacy of this or any other decontamination strategy should be tested. To this end, a low-tech, safe method for culturing viruses should be developed, as well as a method to quantify live/dead viruses. With this platform, the maker community could develop and robustly test decontamination technology. I'm pants-on-fire busy and on the road, but if anyone reading this has suggestions it would be great to keep this rolling.\n        </div>",
