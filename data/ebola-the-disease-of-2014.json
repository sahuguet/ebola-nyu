You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO.

I will do this through social media because it will help my message spread worldwide. I think it will succeed because a lot of people use socal media to learn about things going on throughout the world. A question I have for the community is by giving updates about ebola benefit you and give you more knowledge about the virus?\u00a0\n        </div>",
