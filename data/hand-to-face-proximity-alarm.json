      "message": "\n    \tTravis, I think 1) a new hood design is required to reduce the overall amount of PPE in the field, thus reducing the exposure of on/off of several parts of equipment.  2) I do think a warning sensor for heat exhaustion or exposure to prolonged suit use is a requirement with air circulation in the hood to prevent precipitation, etc.  I wanted to see a cheap use of sensor that could be disposable for quick reads - similar to sensor tape or other embedded devices that could easily be made ruggedized for external application for others to see.  In short, we need a better overall system for PPE against Ebola: 1) external covering easy on/off, 2) wick-away internal skin gear like an under armour that could be washed but absorb sweat, etc (no more cotton scrubs), and 3) 1-piece hood system.  This would provide best-in-class protection in field or in hospitals with easy to understand and very simple training - in the form of videos or leaflets.  Lemme know what you think!\n    "

  "summary": "One risk that surfaces is from habits we don't even think about. My nose itches so I scratch it. My glasses slip down my nose so I push them up. All harmless under normal circumstances but potentially deadly to someone in a PPE around Ebola.This idea is to put reusable wrist bands on caregivers which will trigger a warning chirp if they get within 12 inches of their goggles where a proximity sensor with speaker will be attached. Both wristbands and goggle proximity sensor should:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- be reusable after immersion in disinfectant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- run on inexpensive, long life industry-standard batteries\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- have increasing rate and pitch as the distance closes This would be a fairly easy hack but it needs to be small and elegant.",
