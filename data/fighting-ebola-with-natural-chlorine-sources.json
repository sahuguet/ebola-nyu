  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n<strong>Industrial-grade chlorine</strong> is the main component used to treat materials that have been contaminated with ebola viruses. However, it's also a component that is naturally present in many plant compounds. Chlorine in its pure form is a gas, but in the surface of the Earth it's often found combined with other elements, thus difficult to purify without a lab. In its combined form, chlorine is usually inocuous, except for some molecules present in plants called organochlorines (that can have antibiotic and antiviral proprerties).\n<br/>\n<br/> So the idea would be to research plants that are naturally rich in organochlorine in ebola-affected areas, so they can be collected by volunteers and used to decontaminate ebola-infected material in a plastic bin containing a solution.\n<br/>\n<br/> Of course, this project would require training and research to perfect the techiques and efficacity of obtaining organochlorines this way, but it also can mean a way to get chlorine without the need to import it every time, and also a way to empower local populations against the epidemy.\n<br/>\n<br/> For instance, some species of the Aster family are very rich in chlorinated compounds. The idea would be to search those that are native to western African countries.\n<br/>\n<br/> http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/chlorine-in-nature.aspx\n<br/>\n<br/> http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031942286800024\n        </div>",
