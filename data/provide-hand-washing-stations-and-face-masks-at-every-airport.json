You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Hand washing is the most effective way to prevent the spread of infection and disease. This idea is basic, yet very preventive in that it stops the disease at every country's port of entry, thereby not allowing it to spread by travel. Additionally, the required use of face masks during travel ensures that if someone has ebola but is not yet aware that they do, they will not be able to spread the infection.\u00a0\n        </div>",
