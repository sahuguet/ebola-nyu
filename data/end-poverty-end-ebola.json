Many of them are at risk for catching Ebola because they aren't being protected while trying to help others. Also, it is important to improve the sanitation in many countries, as well as provide them with a clean source of water. This will obviously take some time, but I think that these are necessities and will help stop the spread of future epidemics as well as Ebola.\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Poverty is the biggest factor in disease outbreak. For example, because there is a limited access to proper sanitation in some third world countries, the virus begins to spread more rapidly. The lack of substantial healthcare also puts those healthcare workers in danger because they lack the necessary supplies to protect themselves from the disease. I think the best way to approach ending Ebola is to start providing these countries with better healthcare and clean water. The survival rate in West Africa is 50%. In the US, the survival rate is 80%, and that is largely due to the access to sanitation. By donating supplies or helping with research to make clean water more accessible, we can reduce the risk of Ebola and save many people.",
