It'll help fight viral pandemics. \u00a0The end tipping point in all the combinations of regional conditionals is clean water availablity. \u00a0Right now clean water in the affected region is out of balance.\n<br/> Controlling that will initiate better control to the social economic miragtons, thus as a objective this can drive solutions and timing applications moving forward, while achieving the overall goal of controlled and lasting solutions to climate change conditions that drive pandemic disease. \u00a0 Former Presidents Clinton and Bush found this a primary driver in the aftermath relif efforts in Haiti and the areas affected by the tsunami coastal recoveries in the Indian ocean region. \u00a0\u00a0\n<br/> Available clean water sources healthy start points on the scale first in.\n<br/>\n<br/> MCJ.\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
