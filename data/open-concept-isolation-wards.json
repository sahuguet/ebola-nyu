Privacy would be handled by having to answer.  Questions could be addressed remotely in many cases and a suited worker could be dispatched if necessary.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tFor sure - excellent point!  Tablets and skype would be excellent to improve communication with those in the tent.  Even walkie talkies or cctv.  They could also be  useful for staff to transmit information to others outside the ward.  They could be made available to the field to use them right away!  They are already  being used on very small scale - with careful attention to infection control to make sure they do not cross-contaminate or go from \"dirty\" to \"clean\" areas.      But,  tablets may not work well for everyone, the majority of patients with Ebola virus disease become very asthenic - they even have trouble lifting up cups of water to drink.  Maybe its not one or the other - and for existing closed wards we should be taking more advantage of tablets or other technology to improve communication with those inside.\n    "

Some even have remote controlled cameras, although there still may be practical issues of limited views and positioning.  They are likely designed for monitoring one baby in a quiet room \u2013 not 10 \u2013 50 sick people in a tent.  Psychiatry-wards also have \"built-in\" A/V monitors for some patient rooms that require 24 hour observation.An \u201copen concept\u201d facility may still be useful \u2013 as it may be easier to see and communicate over a short distance in person, and less prone to failure, then through electronic monitors.  That said, remote A/V monitors seem ready for use immediately to help in existing closed wards.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            To limit the time I had to wear PPE, and maximize the time I spent with patients, I began to do my rounds by first seeing all the patients who were well enough to walk outside of their tents.\u00a0 I could talk to these patients safely while I stood in the low risk zone, separated by 2 rows of orange fencing, distance of 2 metres, comfortably, without any PPE.\u00a0 Then, when I entered in full PPE I could concentrate more on those very weak who needed more attention and physical contact.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> With the existing isolation ward structures, the \"talking at a distance\" for patient rounds works well for patients well enough to get up and sit outside.\u00a0 However, for patients that were too sick to walk and bed-ridden, we couldn\u2019t see them or know what was going on in the tents, until we entered the ward dressed in all our PPE gear.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Perhaps innovative \u201copen concept\u201d facilities with open walls or alternate ways to see inside and communicate with patients at a distance without wearing full PPE could maximize verbal and visual communication and improve patient care.\n        </div>",
