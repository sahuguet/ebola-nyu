Any drug that would lower core body temperature would help in theory but there are experimental versions that lower temperature by degree/equivalent dose. \u00a0http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/10/51 This is just an idea, it may be dangerous for all I know but I also know we all reach for antipyretics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol when we have a fever - so the theory is valid.
