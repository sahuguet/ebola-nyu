In fact, transfer factors may someday cure the diseases ravaging the world population, such as AIDS and EBOLA. After the tragic 2002 Ebola outbreak in Uganda, freelance journalist Sam Wainaina explored the potential benefits of transfer factors in Africa. In his\u00a0article, Wainaina concluded that had transfer factors been used during the outbreak, it could have been contained sooner, saving lives and avoiding mass hysteria.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> Cannabis have immense healing power.

We've tested whether the cannabinoids affect common antibiotic\n<br/> targets like fatty acid synthesis or the [DNA-bending enzyme] DNA gyrase, but\n<br/> they don't. I really cannot hazard a guess how they do it, but their high\n<br/> potency as antibiotics suggests there must be a very specific mechanism.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> 100 grams of weed is enough to test!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> Take 5 Ebola patients which are in different deisease phases (early, middle and late) Test different strains which are all high in CBD and CBG.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.leafscience.com/2013/09/18/can-marijuana-combat-catastrophic-rise-drug-resistant-bacteria/\">http://www.leafscience.com/2013/09/18/can-marijuana-combat-catastrophic-rise-drug-resistant-bacteria/</a>\n<br/>\n<br/> \"Prof. Appendino added that the most promising cannabinoids in their study\n<br/> \u2013 cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) \u2013 also happen to be\n<br/> non-psychoactive.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-medical-marijuana/2013/11/cannabidiol-the-side-of-marijuana-you-dont-know/\">http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-medical-marijuana/2013/11/cannabidiol-the-side-of-marijuana-you-dont-know/</a>\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
