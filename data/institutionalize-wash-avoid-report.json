  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            There are three modes that I see this idea being institutionlized through. They are media, organizations, and government.\n<br/>\n<br/> The strongest may be with organizations. This process should be promoted through schools, business of all sizes to emplyees, and any other place people must conform to a rule based group. Have businesses require employees to follow the process and encourage them to carry it home with this, Promote it and practice it through schools so that students can take it home with them and show their families. The key is that it is the same verbal message comeing from multiple places so that it becomes cultural. It must be unified to avoid confusion and mistrust.\n<br/>\n<br/> The next is government. Make sure that all government employees and anyone that the government works with follws the same proceedure. Make it a nationla security issue. If th government goes down, then how will the country run? Also, popular political figure across political factions should unite in radio or TV\u00a0messages promoting the process making more and more aware, citing that it is their national duty.\n<br/>\n<br/> Last is in media. Every moment can be used to promote the process. Every DJ, radio or TV host, and so on, should promote it betfore every story, song, etc.\n<br/>\n<br/> The more ways people hear the more it seems like everyone is already doing it and leading to the thought of maybe I should too.\n        </div>",
