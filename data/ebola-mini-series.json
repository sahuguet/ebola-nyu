My assumption would be that radio and mobile phones would have the widest reach in low resource settings like these and that language and literacy may also make many people tough to reach. What about doing the series in audio formats that could be radio friendly and accessible on feature phones?\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            One way to spread knowledge about the virus would be present the knowledge in a form that is appealing and repeats the message on how to manage the virus, what to do if someone is infected and so on.\n<br/> So, my idea is to create a mini drama using famous African actors acting out characters of people who have been infected, the symptoms and how to treat it.\n<br/>\n<br/> This mini drama could have different stories, repeating the same message but with different cases.\n<br/>\n<br/> These could be spread online or via videos to be shown at places where communities congregate, e.g. churches. \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> If the ebola patients in the mini series go to a hospital, it could deal with one problem of the ebola outbreak:\n<br/>\n<br/> \u201cAt the moment, our big problem is finding the patients in a timely way and convincing them to come to the treatment center,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a carrot to hang out there and bring people in, then you can\u2019t contain it.\u201d\n<br/>\n<br/> http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/health/in-ebola-outbreak-who-should-get-experimental-drug.html?_r=0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ebola Book Series</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/> A writer could be commissioned to produce an e-book where the main character is infected with ebola, and detail the treatment given along with pictures. If this book is written by the right person, it could be both educational and engaging.\n<br/>\n<br/> Separate books would be written for people of different ages. NGOs and Schools in the country could print out the e-books and distribute them to local communities.\n<br/>\n<br/> In communities where literacy rates are low, instead of an e-book, actors could travel to communities and perform a play for the community or comic strips could be distributed.\n<br/>\n<br/> This would give the instructions on what to do with an ebola outbreak more narrative and context than handing out a sheet of instructions.\n<br/> This could be combined with the distribution of kits to treat ebola patients - which was mentioned in someone's idea posted here. \u00a0\n        </div>",
