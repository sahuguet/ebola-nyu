  "summary": "Ebola has been attacking many people of West Africa and has be spreading rapidly. There are few surviver of Ebola and their bodies have created antibodies to fight Ebola which can be vital to help create a serum and/or protect others from being infected. There is an issues because many people in Africa have HIV's and various diseases that could possible harm people who don't have this issues. The main way that WHO is helping people with ebola is by having them get blood transfusions with people who have already had ebola and this can easily spread other disease. I think the best possible way to help patients is to create a serum with the blood/antibodies  of patient's who survived ebola.",
