Andre posted a similar concept already implemented by UNICEF called RapidPRO - https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/rapidpro-unicef-a-simple-app-to-enhance-communication.  Kate also had one for tracing contact - https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/contact-tracing-for-medical-staff and Chuka had one about establishing a toll free SMS line https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/the-ebola-toll-free-sms-helpline. It seems like your ideas would benefit from some collaboration around this idea. It would be great for you guys to connect. Check out their ideas and drop them a comment :)\n    "

We can give organizations like the cdc the power to send custom SMS messages to people wherever they are in infected areas.\n<br/>\n<br/> I've finished the front end where a user can login, create, edit, and schedule sms messages to be sent.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> Currently working on integrating with the twilio api and setting up a server that will host the app initially for demo purposes.\n<br/>\n<br/> This application / service is built in GO (golang).\n        </div>",

Currently I'm developing it so that people can text a number and receive SMS messages on a defined basis in the app.",
