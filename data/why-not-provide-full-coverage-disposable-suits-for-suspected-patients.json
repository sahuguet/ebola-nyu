It takes energy to operate the fans and theres a possible exposure to airborne droplets when its pressurized-They do it -but its not easy-but its would work if they could solve those problems\n    "

These could be less expensive and disposable, and is cheaper to provide for the one patient if not all the health workers and personnel can be equipped with level 4 suits.\n        </div>",
