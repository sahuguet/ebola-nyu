Clearly this app works well in that kind of context. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetrationLiberia has a basic cell phone penetration rate of 42 percent, with 2,8 percent of the population with access to internet. http://www.africareview.com/Business---Finance/Liberia-mobile-phone-subscribers-increase/-/979184/1938786/-/5g4kdk/-/index.htmlHow could this solution be adapted to the current context on the ground there? Would it be possible to use SMS to deliver this information?\n    "

Ltd. has taken lead in providing healthcare support over the mobile platform by enabling around half a million downloads collectively across platforms like Blackberry and Android.\n<br/>\n<br/> Bolstered by the success in Indonesia, a new version of Dokter GratisTM, named Doctor GratisTM has been released in West \u00a0Africa to help the care-seekers to get answers to their health-related queries.\n<br/>\n<br/> Health2i has accelerated the development and launch of the application in Africa to provide support on the current life threatening crisis of Ebola. The Doctor Gratis mobile application can be used to seek free consultations and information related to Ebola.\n<br/>\n<br/> Ebola, as the whole world knows by now, is a virus disease highly infectious and the current outbreak in West Africa is the largest and most complex since the virus was discovered first in 1976.\n<br/>\n<br/> To address this grave situation, Doctor Gratis has joined hands with all those who are fighting hard to keep the spread of Ebola in check.\n<br/>\n<br/> Android App Download Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.gits.Hospital.Singapore&amp;hl=en_GB\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> Doctor Gratis has roped in a team of physicians in Nigeria to drive the initiative further and manage the community locally in West Africa.\n<br/> Online doctors and relevant published articles deliver the information and the appropriate advice. Alongside classical means of alert, Doctor Gratis constitutes another level of interaction between patients and doctors.\n<br/>\n<br/> The project managers invite like-minded organizations and individuals to join hands in the fight to push back Ebola and restore good health and confidence in future generations.\n<br/>\n<br/> Interested participants may please get in touch with contacts listed at the response center website setup at http://doctorgratis.org/ebola-outbreak-response/\n<br/>\n<br/> About Doctor Gratis\n<br/> Doctor Gratis is a mobile application platform operated by Health2i Pte Ltd that enables healthcare consumers to seek basic information on health topics prior to any medical consultation with a physician.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
