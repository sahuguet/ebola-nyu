Both the advantages and challenges are as wide as they are deep. I, along with the global community, would solicit any input for productive discussion.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "In layman:  This developing concept is to provide awareness to Medical RFID implementation, as well as to encourage those 1) within an infected geographical region, or 2) within direct or indirect contact with a carrier to consider this medical availability. The data secured from willing participants would cross-correlate human temperature with an array of high risk virus characteristics. This both proactive and reactive approach could help identify, locate and assist carriers in near real-time. Successful implementation in current high risk regions could 1) provide tangible solutions on mapping the virus threat, 2) provide invaluable case studies for further implementation, and 3) sustainably address similar epidemics in the future.",
