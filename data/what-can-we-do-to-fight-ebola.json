All of us should pay more attention to the awareness of environment around us and try to balance the development of society and issues from environment.

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n<br/> Why all the catastrophes of the world normally happen in undeveloped countries? Is because of that, because they are un-developed. Why are undeveloped? They are because we are developed, it\u2019s as clear as that. Now that we have seen that the problem can affect us we are worried.\n<br/>\n<br/> If we try to build a balanced world in the future by educating our sons in a respectful live stile and we change our selfish way of acting in the future the reaction to a big problem like Ebola will have a faster reaction. \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> What we could do for the next time? Start fighting the problem when it appears, in Africa.\n        </div>",
