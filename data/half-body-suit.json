      "message": "\n    \tHi there,oxygene cartridges  - honestly, I don't know, this is a brainstorm. However, it might be worth taking a close look at scuba diving equipment, there are minimal rescue packages available. Maybe one cartridge is enough to keep the pressure inside higher than outside. This would be a cost cut. The oxygen cartridge might be enough.How to take it on or off?On: I can imagine this works like putting on a sweater. It could be neatly folded inside an large envelope or container. Off: maybe there is a mechanism similar to the zipper on a wetsuit, that allows you to open the gear with a simple motion while covering the potentially contaminated outside.\n    "

The suit should be worn over your \"normal\" clothes but still create a safe environment inside. With that, it should feel a bit more human.",
