This serum's benefits might be able to lead to an effective solution or even a cure or prevention agaisnt the war on Ebola. Futhurmore this idea of developing a serum using the antibodies of patients that have survived the disease could also be applied on a larger scale and sould be used to fight other diseases as well.\u00a0\n        </div>",
