  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Hand washing is key to the treatment of ebola and often this is the thing that medical staff may forget. Therefore, my idea is to install squeezy bottles with alcohol solution above the handles of all entry and exits to hospitals to reduce the infection risk of all medical staff and visitors.\n<br/>\n<br/> I believe that someone has invented a door handle that has a sanitary spray impregnated in it. I can find out more if you like.\n<br/>\n<br/> This could be expanded to other locations.\u00a0\n        </div>",
