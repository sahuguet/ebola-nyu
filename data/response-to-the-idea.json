You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) have come up with an idea that could possibly save thousands of lives. They have decided that they will try to transfuse the blood of survivors to those patients who are currently suffering from the Ebola virus. I can understand how the researchers believe that this can help the patients currently suffering from Ebola. However, this will hypothetically cause more pain than good. The reason for this is that the chances of the blood being accepted by the patient's immune system are high, but the chance that the immune system of the patient will accept the antibodies from the donor. The blood transfusion is a good idea, however the risk for disease (such as HIV or Hepatitis), possible rejection of the blood\u00a0from the patients immune system, and risk of the doctors infection is too high of a chance to be outweighed by the patients life being saved.\n        </div>",
