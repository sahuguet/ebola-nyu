  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            There will be a truck carrying highly visual and image-centric educational pamphlets in local languages, equipment for testing ebola, and incentives for community members (to be determined by location). After arriving at a highly frequented community node such as a well, the mobile unit will engage with community members by offering incentives in exchange for their time. Pamphlets and conversation will be available, and community members will be given the option of getting tested once they are comfortable with the mobile team. If possible, one test will stay with the mobile unit while another is taken by the participant to review in privacy. Three possible scenarios follow:\n<br/> 1) The test is negative. Trust and relief have been inspired in the participant\n<br/> 2) The test is positive, and the participant does not elect to seek treatment. The mobile team cannot force the person to enter isolation, but they can offer more education about self-isolation and share that data point with ebola tracking organizations.\n<br/> 3) The test is positive, and the participant elects to seek treatment. The participant stays with the mobile team to receive preliminary care while waiting for transportation to a treatment facility.\u00a0\n        </div>",
