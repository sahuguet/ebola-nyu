      "message": "\n    \tHi Frank, interesting post! Any chance you could find an image to go along with it? Images help grab attention and tell a story with higher impact. You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Thermal imaging cameras cost as little as $1000 and have adequate thermal resolution and rapid response so that they can\u00a0measure skin temperature, such as of the forehead, by noncontact imaging as prospective passengers pass by in a line.\u00a0 Persons with elevated \u00a0temperature\u00a0can thus be taken out of line for\u00a0quick screening, such as questioning about past travel or contact with infected persons, and questions about other\u00a0fever inducing diseases or conditions.\u00a0 This process\u00a0results in minimal inconvenience for persons with no fever, and quick evaluation of additional factors.\u00a0 Persons who do have a fever\u00a0and have other\u00a0indicators of possible disease can then be\u00a0subjected to more rigorous screening or quarantine.\u00a0 The results of the screening can then be used as data\u00a0to input a dynamic map of disease spread, to\u00a0speed\u00a0decisions on where to deploy available resources to best effect.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Thermal imagers are readily available today.  Use a thermal camera to screen passengers before they enter transportation.  Divert passengers who appear to have a fever for additional questioning, such as where they have been, whether they have been in the presence of sick persons, and what key symptoms they presently exhibit.  Select out the persons of highest risk of disease for more diagnostic procedures and perhaps quarantine.   This method also creates data for a dynamic map of disease spread.  This simple measure will reduce the flow of infected persons to other areas, reducing the geographic spread of disease, so that available resources can be deployed for the most effective response.",
