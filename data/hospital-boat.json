  "summary": "During the response to Haiti's earthquake disaster, the USA stationed a hospital boat to care for injured patients. Perhaps a military hospital boat could be retrofitted to care for infected health care workers.  It might help reassure caregivers that there is an ICU waiting for them if they get sick.  I understand the army is building a hospital, but I suspect that will get overrun.",
