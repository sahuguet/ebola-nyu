It solves both problems of heat and protection.  We are working with USAid, & OSTP to toss out some potential ideas.  At this point, the biggest obstacles we face are cost and logistics.  Just to let you know that NASA is in the game and trying to lend what support we can.\n    "

Wondering how the various connections are being made around needs for this crisis.  I posted an IDEA early in the challenge which asked how different industries, such as the aerospace industry, might help with these designs.  So now I am curious as to how the dots are being connected in the real world. Thanks for letting us know what you are all doing and who you are collaborating with!\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tCost!  Of course.  It's worth spending over a billion dollars per person to get someone on the surface of the moon, but saving a few lives in Africa and limiting the spread of infection throughout the world and to healthcare workers with priceless years of experience and unique knowledge?  Well now we need to draw up a budget.  This kind of prioritization is so mindless, on every level.   I'm being serious.  I know it sounds sarcastic but I've had this sentiment since I first saw those healthcare workers on TV.  Those things are garbage bags compared to space suits.   And the second thought was, why isn't NASA spearheading this movement?  I guess because it doesn't directly affect the space program, but I thought NASA did things like develop medicine. The impetus for placing this idea here was the frustration I have with the state of national and international priority when it comes to sharing and deploying high-tech, government resources.  I don't have in my hands the resources to make this barrier suit happen and I don't know whether or not USAID would even be interested because, based on the addenda, they want something that is cheaper, better and easier to deploy.  And yet they are calling for all ideas.  The original invention needs to go beyond the initial, foreseeable financial limitations.  The suit has to be as perfect and modifiable as possible, then time and further research can bring the cost of technology down and make it's deployment more efficient.  This is what all of us have observed with the personal computing industry.  It started with a great idea, it was executed with a lot of seed money, and affordability has come with time and further invention.  I'm just glad I was able to put this idea out on the web and have a handful of people see it.  Thank you for updating us, David.  Please, if possible, pass this sentiment along to the government community.  Good luck with your work.\n    "

They do the same thing-but one is made to be in and out for short time-the other is for long duration. There are systems that can do either-but they are weak in some way or another. So-lets set up 2 strings of thought-one for field-heavy duty, one for inhospital use. lets start getting specifics design ideas, and start working taking it to the people who can make it happen-we can get all the ideas in the world and never get it out there.\n    "
