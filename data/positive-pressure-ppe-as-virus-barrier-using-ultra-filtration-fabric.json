You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            I am inspired by this idea because it connects with my interests in material science and filtration membranes. \u00a0\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> The second part of this idea is to use a source of clean air under pressure, such as the HEPA filtered backpack unit described in Bob Hauck's contribution. \u00a0The idea is that pressurized air will keep viruses from infitrating the PPE. Also, moving air provides for convective heat transfer, cooling the wearer. I like Bob Hauck's idea of venting through the armpits.\u00a0\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> HEPA standards may not be sufficient, as they are rated to remove 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns (300 nm). A lot depends upon the shape the virus coils itself into.\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/> I'm also wondering if there would be another way to power the fan, such as rechargeable batteries and a portable solar power unit.\u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "There has been a lot of talk about preventing the spread of Ebola by avoiding contact with body fluids of the infected patient. However, Ebola virus is about 80 nm in diameter and 970 nm long, much larger than water molecules about 0.3 nm. If we use a membrane which is permeable to water and air molecules but not to viruses, we could offer protection to the wearer, but also increase comfort.",
