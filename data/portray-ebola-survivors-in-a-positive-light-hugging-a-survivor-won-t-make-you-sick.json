Maybe you can both collaborate -  https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/use-the-bleach-and-those-who-ve-survived-more-effectively. How might we publicly celebrate these survivors and re-frame them as heroes/heroines that can help the rest of the community?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tThanks for this great summary regarding stigma of Ebola.  This is also what I got out of it:1. Healthcare workers/caregivers simply helping patients. \" had to rush quickly to help her. She was going to fall off the bed, and I was trying to support her. I didn't have time to put on my gown. \"2. Stigma can be overcome by a certificate: \"When I showed them the certificate, they started to welcome me.\" Also, could have helped Martin's case/story.3. Knowledge of how to care for Ebola patients is critical. She survived because her sister and and husband were medical people. (which raises the question:How do we get a similar amount of knowledge to non-medical people? Family members/caregivers that do not have such knowledge) Some awareness campaigns1.

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Ebola is mostly portrayed as a definite death sentence, making it hard to believe that anyone could recover and survive the illness.\u00a0However, as the existance of survivors demonstrate, Ebola patients have some hope of recovery. Survivors can\u00a0return to a normal life\u00a0after a months-long recovery that can include periods of hair loss, sensory changes, weakness, fatigue, headaches, and eye and liver inflammation*.\u00a0But, how to build trust on this outcome? How to convince people that the person they have in front of them pose no risk to their health?\n<br/>\n<br/> * \n<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/12/5992083/the-story-of-an-ebola-outbreak-survivor\">What it feels like to have Ebola (interview with a survivor)</a>\n<br/>\n<br/> In general, there seems to be little unclear information about the recovery outcome and what happens to the organism of a surviving person. \n<a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/nigeria_76103.html\">Misconceptions and stigma abound</a>. Some publications report the following regarding Ebola survivors: \n<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/07/us-health-ebola-condoms-idUSKCN0HW1P820141007\">men should restrain from having unprotected sex for up to 90 days</a> and women should ask their doctors before breastfeeding their babies again or consider other feeding methods. Information like this might be the reason for comments such as (taken from this \n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/08/13/they-survived-ebola-now-they-are-shunned/\">article</a>): \n<ul>\n<li>\"I am happy Dr. Korkor has returned but I am totally not convinced he is Ebola free. I will shake his hands after 21 days.\"</li>\n<li>\"I will greet him from a distance.\"</li>\n<li>\"I still haven't taken my exams while my classmates have moved on to the next level. The professors said they were going to grade me by telephone.\"</li>\n<li>\"Ebola has ruined my life even though I am cured. No one wants to spend a minute in my company for fear of being contaminated.\"</li>\n<li>\"People don't believe that I had Ebola because they can't believe I survived.\"</li>\n</ul> There are many misconceptions about the survivors, but with the great potential of good things that they can bring to their communities we should turn their image into a positive one.\n<br/> Ebola survivors\u00a0working on hospitals, like\u00a0 \n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/09/26/351735172/the-ebola-survivor-who-works-in-an-ebola-ward\">Dauda Fullah</a> does,\u00a0can provide moral support to existing patients and facilitate the interaction between them and their doctors: \n<em>He provides more than medical support. Helena Makeni, a nurse who cared for Fullah, says that he encourages the patients who are really struggling. He goes up to them and says, \"Look, I've been through this, and I survived. Just do what the doctors say, and keep fighting.\" And they listen.</em>\n<br/> Survivors can also help to clarify misconceptions as the ones that \n<a href=\"http://www.who.int/features/2014/life-after-ebola/en/\">Mohamed</a> found:\u00a0 \n<em>people told him they think that being an Ebola patient means that you are dead, you will never recover, that it will kill you, no matter what you do.</em>\n<br/>\n<br/> What to do?:\n<br/> 1) Make survivors' stories easily available to the affected communities. Having access to internet, it took me quite some effort to find survivors' stories as most of the news related to Ebola are about its current spread and growth. Guess how unlikely it might be for isolated communities to learn about survivors.\n<br/> 2)\u00a0Following the approach taken for cancer survivors, portray Ebola survivors as a celebration of life.\n<br/> 3) Make clear that survivors don't carry the Ebola virus in their blood and\u00a0teach the community on how Ebola survivors won't get them sick. We may use printed materials (stickers on taxis? informative cards?) to spread mesages such as: \"Hugging an Ebola survivor won't make you sick\" or \"Having dinner with a survivor can't give you Ebola\".\u00a0 \n<a href=\"https://www.internationalsos.com/ebola/index.cfm?content_id=410&amp;\">Once someone recovers from Ebola, they can no longer spread the virus\u00a0except via their semen or, possibly, breastmilk (and only for a limited time).</a>\n</div>",
