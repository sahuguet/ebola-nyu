  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            The current Ebola outbreak isn't the first in the world, there has been various cases of it happening before. The earliest was 1976. It's fair to assume that this has been present in nature long before human's have discovered it. If so, there's a chance that, through natural selection, some animals have developed natural responses or resistance to the virus. We should examine healthy African primates or bats infected with the ebola virus for possible natural resistance. From there try to figure out how to replicate or reinforce humans' resistance to the virus. Another thing to examine is behavioural patterns or diet that could explain the survival rates for infected primates.\n        </div>",
