      "message": "\n    \tGreat point Chris. This is definitely a tricky challenge to solve. How might we identify areas of virus contamination on the surface of the protective gear/skin before it comes off? Your concerns about the water spreading the molecules are important, so is there a way we could identify and sanitize them before showering or exposure to water. I saw some other posts about using UV light, although I'm not qualified to comment on whether that is an effective solution. Perhaps some further research might present some interesting developments to this idea? Good luck!\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n<p>You set up a three stage mobile shower system. Stage one, while still in full protective gear, shower wash down with a very heavy Clorox based solution to clear most of the junk off and sanitize the suit. Step two, still in the suit is a regular shower with soap and brushes to clean off any residual contamination.\u00a0 Stage three is showering while removing the protective gear and then stepping directly into a clean zone to dry off, change out of your wet undergarments and get dressed. Sounds complicated but is actually very easy to set up and operate.</p>\n</div>",
