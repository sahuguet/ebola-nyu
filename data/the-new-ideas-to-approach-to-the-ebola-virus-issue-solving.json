  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Unlike influenza virus, Ebola Virus spikes protein bound to an antibody from a human survivor. Ebola had five strains and it mutates. However, if we can find the similarities these five strains Ebola virus share, we can easily target the main protein and find the drugs to block out the signaling of Ebola protein.\n<br/> Further more, the cured patients can donate their blood plasma for further research. Since they develop the certain antibodies, we can contrast their blood plasma before getting infected with Ebola and after they survived.\n        </div>",
