      "message": "\n    \tThis is a good idea.  One issue with hotels is that they use fabrics, carpets, and woods to give a sense of comfort or luxury.   An operating room, conversely, is built around non-porous, even re-sterilizable, hard smooth surfaces.  So hotels have a decontamination risk in their design:  if some body fluids from an ebola patient spill onto a carpet - how do you clean this up afterwards?  Will doctors ever use that room again?   How do you decontaminate the hotel and return it to the owners once the ebola outbreak is over?  None of these issues are insurmountable - someone just needs to repurpose/rebuild the rooms to a medical standard\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Chris, building on Rik's comment, is there another type of space that isn't being used in the affected areas? Perhaps one that simulates hospital space in the sense that they can be easily disinfected? Besides the physical decontamination, it is often hard to get the community to psychologically feel comfortable using these spaces again. How might we change or maintain the perceptions to be positive? Are there any sanitation technologies we can leverage? Thanks for the contribution! Good luck!\n    "
