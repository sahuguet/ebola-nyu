Sounds similiar to those old \"Rife\" machines you read about.  Apparently virus have something called a caspid (some kind of shell) which can resonate if you find its frequency. I'm sure this could work and I can't see how the virus could adapt to it.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \t[translated by google]thank you for your attention, I would first like to say that I was only a lover of physics, and I work in the computer field. I think that, the size of the virus, or the basic unit of the virus, is greater than most other virus, but still too small compared to the cells of our body. This means that the resonant frequency of the Ebola virus would be very different than our DNA / RNA ,  that means, if we can find this frequency, it should be safe,  because it should be very far from the frenquency of our cells and bones.Now the(or my) question is: what would this frequency? few kilohertz? some Mhz ?   It is up to scientists having the necessary equipment to scan to find,   if this frequency fell in the region of 20 kHz and 50 kHz, we should be able to make a machine because there are already machines ultrasound for industrial cleaning business, but is it that our bones are also on this frequency? Scientists should have an answer.\n    "
