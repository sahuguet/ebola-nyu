There is certainly not a drug against Ebola counterpart but there are people who survive this disease.Give hope or infect hope is of great value. Infected who refuse to submit to health centers for fear they will get out that will support the earlier is the best option to take. This is the option that all survivors of Ebola have taken.The campaign will also reduce the excessive fear of people, especially the fear of relatives of those who were infected\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            The surviors compromise about \n<strong>50% of the infected population</strong>. As they are cleared from\u00a0 Ebola and discharged from care facilities, they face great challenges. There is a stigma associated with any infected person as people often try to aviod and alienate them. They are also dealing with great losses themselves as most have lost a number of family\u00a0members \u00a0and loved ones to this\u00a0illness. The pain and alienation they are experiencing -I would argue- is in itself more harmful than the virus. To impower them and allow them the opputniuty to become wellness and awareness embassadors through this project has the following advantages:\n<br/> 1.\u00a0\u00a0Give the survivors\u00a0a sense of purpose and allow\u00a0them to psychologically heal by\u00a0helping others.\n<br/> 2. Spread awareness regarding the Ebola virus\u00a0and how it is possible with the proper care and precautions to overcome it and prenvent it's spread. These individuals\u00a0 will not only be informative but also a living testimony to what they will teach.\n<br/> 3. The survivors have\u00a0 an acquired immunity to the illness, this enables them with proper training after their recovery\u00a0to attend to the sick with less cumbersome gear and not risk getting sick. Their work can be\u00a0supervised\u00a0by doctors and nurses. For a patient who is fighting the illness or is dying from it seeing another survivor attend to him/her, holding their hands and not being utterly terrified of exposure\u00a0is much more encouraging and comforting than personal with space suits. Doctors without Borders\u00a0have been utilizing\u00a0 survivors in such manner, but I suggest to even expand these efforts to where these individuals will not only assist but take the lead in providing care and doing such tasks as drawing blood and inserting IV lines and so forth.\u00a0\n<br/> My hope is that through such\u00a0movement, \u00a0we can start a survivor global network that would connect people who overcame various\u00a0tragedies and obstacles\u00a0be it of war, illness, natural disasters...etc. This will give those\u00a0amazing individuals the platform to encourage others and shed light on various pressing issues. This will give them the opportunity to INFECT HOPE to each other and to all of us. Furthermore, It will also connect them with\u00a0global advocates, scientists, and sponsors that can further their causes and also provide things such as scholarships, funding for local projects, and even foster homes for those in need.\u00a0 Please support this project as I know this can turn into a global force that is capable of inspiring and ushering in tangible change and truly infecting hope. \u00a0\u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",

Activating this extraordinary  group of individuals and deploying them into action to fight, educate and inspire  is the prime focus of this proposal. This project will take  the negative association of \"infect\" and reintroduce it in a positive and powerful light; that of  \"Hope\".",
