      "message": "\n    \tHi Rebecca.Yes there are gadgets that one can wear on their person to monitor heart rate for sports and also for medical reasons.  They vary in price and none are cheap. Some are worn on the body and some for sports seem to be only on the wrist.  Either way they are mechanical devices and could get contaminated during patient care.   The way I was thinking was that if one can take their own pulse, or another provider can do it that costs nothing.  They can either use a stethoscope, which they may already be using for patient care, or they can use their hands - not sure if one can feel the pulse through so many layers of gloves.  I can try that myself and get back to you.The issue here for me is whether experts would find this measure accurate enough.  Each person would need to know their resting heart rate and use that as a base measure.  ( Since it seems simple, it might not be a useable idea, as I would think someone would have already considered it.  You never know though so I threw it out there.)\n    "

Approaches to temperature monitoring have been suggested.  We do not have a simple low cost solution yet.   As heart rate increases with elevated body temperature can we devise a way for health workers to monitor their own pulse, or monitor each other's pulse?",
