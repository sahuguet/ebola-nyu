Each room will have UV lamps to disinfect everything within that room. Health care workers returning from the field will go though the three rooms in sequence to doff their PPE. First room will have very high intensity UV to remove the outer layer. The next room will have medium intensity UV to remove the inner layer. The third room will have low intensity UV plus bleach so that the person can stand there for 3 mins as rinse their hands in bleach. This way the time taken to doff PPE can be reduced by a lot\n        </div>",
