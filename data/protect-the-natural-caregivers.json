  "summary": "We need to protect the natural caregivers-family members of Ebola victims. Instead of providing protective suits for those that are well we need to provide a way to isolate and care for the sick at home. Family members are becoming primary caregivers due to the shortage of hospital beds, treatment facilities and volunteer health care workers. By providing an ALL IN ONE ISOLATION AND TREATMENT KIT we can enable family members to continue to provide care while preventing the spread of the virus, respecting cultural values and maintaining family and community connection.",
