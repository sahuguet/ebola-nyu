You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO.

  "summary": "Graduating in the middle east, i have traveled to many parts of the word.  One of my destinations was Kuwait.  While entering Kuwait, waiting to go through customs a I was very interested by a device they had in the airport.  This was around the time that swine flue was a big problem in the world.  There was a device that used thermal imaging to tell if someone could possible have the swine flue in a matter of seconds and if they did they could not enter the country.  This idea should be implemented all over the world for ebola to stop its spread.  There is new technology for ebola \"quick tests\" that would allow a person to be diagnosed in a matter of hours. This could help stop the spread of ebola internationally.",
