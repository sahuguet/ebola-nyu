  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Ebola scares many people. Indeed, confusion still exists in the U.S. and around the world about how Ebola is acquired and what the exact symptoms are of this deadly disease.\u00a0Thus, a mobile application designed by top healthcare professionals that provides an easy to read description (at a very simple reading level) of the virus would be very helpful. In addition, it would be beneficial if the application included a checklist of common Ebola symptoms. Patients who are worried that they may have been exposed to Ebola could go step by step to see if it is likely they have the disease or not. If the app's algorythm determines that it is above a certain threshold that the person may have Ebola, the phone number of the most local healthcare provider that can handle Ebola cases will appear on the application. If it is determined that the person likely does not have Ebola, the app will remind the individual to continue to look out for certain symptoms and to utilize the app again if anything changes. Furthermore, the app will include contact information for the CDC and other world organizations/experts. In Africa, a communical telemedicine version (or the same type of cell phone app version) could be used.\u00a0\n        </div>",

Currently, a lot of medical jargon is being thrown around that people are struggling to understand. In addition, the application would include a check list of symptoms; individuals who are worried they may have Ebola would be able to go one-by-one down the checklist. Based on input my world experts, the results of going down the checklist would suggest contacting healthcare services or not. If it did recommend contacting healthcare services, the local number of the BEST equipped Ebola care center would be noted on the app. In Africa, a village or communal version of this app (via telemedicine or cell phones) may work.",
