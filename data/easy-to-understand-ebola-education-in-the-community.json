      "message": "\n    \tWomen present differently. This speaks to men but abnormal vaginal bleeding or miscarriage should be part of this as well. In addition I would add positive material such as \"when you recover\" remember you can still sexually transmit the disease for up 90 days, use a condom or abstain...breast milk is also an issue. Part of the reason I think we can't get this to stop spreading is not only the cultural issues but ignoring that sperm and breast milk still have the virus. I would also make sure that the myths are addressed which are many in Sierra Leone.\n    "

Also, think about existing social practices that the communities have and how we can leverage this to spread information. Looking forward to seeing this develop. Here's another idea that might inspire you - https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/ebola-information-on-sachet-water-bags.\n    "

It's getting to the point where every time someone coughs, they are socially quarantined without good reason and we aren't even at high risk yet.\n    "

Obviously the more we order the cheaper the price per unit becomes. We would be happy to place logos on the material if a sponsor/funder required it and can send individual quotes for print and delivery once we know the volumes required, languages and destinations - we can also print locally if needed.\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Jincom use visual media to simplify complex information, making it engaging for all audiences and more effective at achieving positive behaviour change (http://www.jincom.com). In reaction to the current Ebola crisis, we have produced a free 2-page A4 brochure (see pics) in English & French to educate people about Ebola  and advise on the precautions to take. We are now looking for partners to get involved with funding print, delivery and distribution of this piece, so that we can reach thousands of people in the affected communities with this  easy-to-understand information. We can translate & adapt the artwork accordingly and we're also developing a children's comic style version which will be ready by 28th October. Feedback greatly appreciated.",
