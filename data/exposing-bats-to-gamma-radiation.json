  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            If we consider the possible transmission channels of ebola the most mobile and uncontrolleble ones are flying ones, that is fruit bats.\n<br/> Whether we stop \u00a0or not within humans if we dont control the most mobile cause it will be always uncontrollable.\n<br/> The solution must not alter the ecosystem balance.\n<br/> I suggest attracting fruit bats to spesific areas and exposing them to low level Co60 gamma radiation rays in high risk hot climate countries in africa. Those areas must be \u00a0human free zones such as \u00a0some selected areas of forests \u00a0within fences. Hundreds of gamma radiators will \u00a0be active during a period of time \u00a0changing locations \u00a0during year. Local countries will corporate in organizing the operation and \u00a0update \u00a0bat cleaning \u00a0maps and \u00a0share.\n<br/> The same precaution can also be considered on death bodies before burial.\n        </div>",
