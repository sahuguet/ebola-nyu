You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO.

  "summary": "One of the main issues with the safety of the Ebola suits is the fact that the workers are getting so hot that they are having to put on and take off the suit every 40 minutes or so. To help decrease this happening, there should be some sort of fan installed in the suit to help circulate air to make it less hot for the workers.",
