  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            \u00a0Many doctors state that with proper support, our immune system is able to fight this pathogen. My suggestion is this: why not after a suspected exposure to Ebola, an individual be given a dose of a known vaccine in the RNA virus family like a Measles vaccine, activating thus an immune response that may help fight off the virus. \n<em><strong>so basically using a known safe vaccine as a treatment rather than a preventative measure. </strong></em>it is worth trying and its available now. Anyhow like I said I am by no means a scientist, so if anyone out there think there any merit to this let me know. kind regards to you all\n        </div>",

  "summary": "I have no medical experience whatsoever, so please excuse my language which lacks the accurate scientific terminology. What I do is teach architecture; a field that is routed in responding to needs and offering elegant and efficient solutions to problems. when talking to students, many time changing the orientation of a model or a drawing allows us to see things from a different vantage point and find a more appropriate response to the problem at hand. My point is  to think outside the box and reinvent a solution by moving the variables around. As I have been reading a lot about the behaviors of the Ebola virus. my understanding is that its strength lies is its abilities to deceive the immune system and delay a response.",
