  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            Ebola virus disease (EVD) is extremely\u00a0infectious and carries a high mortality rate. The\u00a0virus triggers neutrophils and other\u00a0polymorphonuclear leukocytes causing their\u00a0activation and massive release of inflammatory mediators, particularly cytokines (ie,\u00a0TNFalpha, IL1, IL6, MCP1, MCSF, etc) and interferons (ie, IFNgamma) resulting in\u00a0suppression of the immune system that is unable to combat infection. \u00a0After the 14 \u2013\u00a021 days incubation period, initial flu-like symptoms rapidly progress to systemic\u00a0inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), severe hypotension mediated by\u00a0overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), multiple organ failure (MOF), internal and external\u00a0bleeding as a result of complement activation (C3a, C5a) and vascular permeability;\u00a0and in most cases death. No definitive treatment exists for symptomatic patients.\n<br/>\n<br/> Therapy is only supportive and the still unapproved ZMapp antibody cocktail only\u00a0showed some benefit in asymptomatic cases. Preventive vaccines, even if available,\u00a0have limited effectiveness, and will be compromised by constant mutations.\n<br/>\n<br/> Immutrix blood cleansing technology is expected to remove all mediators of\u00a0symptomatic Ebola patients.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 The novel extracorporeal treatment with ImmutriX proprietary adsorbents allows\u00a0complete removal of inflammatory mediators (ie, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, MCP-1,\u00a0MCSF and IFN-gamma) which suppress the patient\u2019s immune system provoking SIRS\u00a0and limiting production of immunoglobulins to combat the virus.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 Effective removal of NO treats hypotension, preventing multiple organ failure.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 Clearance of complement fragments (C3a, C5a) and adhesion molecules stopping\u00a0vascular leakage, preventing internal and external hemorrhage.\n<br/>\n<br/> \u2022 Blood cleansing from these factors is expected to allow full recovery.\n<br/>\n<br/> ImmutriX Therapeutics, Inc., is a private pre-commercial medical device company based in Rapid City, South Dakota. \u00a0Research conducted by the company has demonstrated effective removal of approximately 70 molecular targets associated with disease or illness from whole blood and/or plasma. \u00a0Safety of the treatment has been demonstrated in animals however no human tests have been performed. \u00a0The treatment is similar to well accepted hemodialysis-like procedures.\n<br/>\n<br/> The Company is preparing for scale up production and human clincial trials for other indications not related to EVD. \u00a0The Company is seeking private equity investment and research grants.\n<br/>\n<br/> Contact info:\n<br/>\n<br/> ImmutriX Therapeutics, Inc.\n<br/> 4200 Beach Drive, Suite 6\n<br/> Rapid City, SD \u00a057702\n<br/> (605)721-7979\n<br/> info@immutrix.com\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",

  "summary": "The Ebola virus is extremely infectious and carries a high mortality rate.  The ultimate cause of death in infected people is immune system suppression, massive release of inflammatory mediators, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), and multiple organ failure (MOF).ImmutriX Therapeutics, Inc. has been engaged in research and  development of an adsorption technology that has the ability to efficiently and selectively remove a broad range of pro inflammatory mediators from blood.  We believe that utilizing this therapy would allow full recovery in symptomatic Ebola patients.",
