  "summary": "For use OVER ppe gear. Was speculating whether maybe a boot, helmet, bracers etc with built in pressurized cryogenic liquid compartments put on over any type of ppe gear- would work to cool parts of the body without compromising or altering the protective gear.Preferably an inert non toxic gas but seeing as it's in a reinforced compartment maybe ammonia could be used (NASA use ammonia) Possibly even liquid nitrogen or a similar cryogenic liquid.Cryoboot, Cryohelm,Maybe compartments that can be topped up and re-pressurized through valves similar to gas cylinder valves.One possible drawback would be the enormous pressure the liquid gas capsules would be under in order to keep the gas cold.  (Sole as one compartment?)",
