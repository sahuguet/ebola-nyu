Maybe you can both collaborate -  https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/portray-ebola-survivors-in-a-positive-light-hugging-a-survivor-won-t-make-you-sick. How might we publicly celebrate these survivors and re-frame them as heroes/heroines that can help the rest of the community?\n    "
