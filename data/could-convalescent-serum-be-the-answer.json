The thought process through this is the people who have overcome this disease have anti-bodies in their blood to help fight Ebola. Antibodies are proteins used in the immune system to identify foreign objects such as a virus in this case and attack it to rid the body of this item. What other diseases could be contracted through giving blood transfusions to infected patients? Are there major health issues in giving blood in these West African villages? These thoughts raced through the readers mind while comprehending this article. Some testing has been done and a few people have survived from this technique but not enough data has been proven to begin using it. According to the article about half of the people that contract this disease results in death. If this many people are dying steps need to be taken on trying any and all methods possible to cure this horrid disease before it progresses to many other people and parts of the world. A downfall to this idea is that the testing required before use can truly begin will require extensive time being tested on non-humans like primates to see the reaction. If the donor of blood is tested thoroughly before the transfusion this idea could possibly become a lifesaver for those infected.\n<br/>\n<br/> Source:\u00a0http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/08/who-ponders-treating-ebola-infected-people-blood-survivors\n        </div>",
