You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            I believe that with a little more research this convalescents serum could be a step in the right direction. Obviously, nothing is working very well right now with the Ebola outbreak, so with some new light coming in on the subject maybe we can fix it. Although it has risks, the possibility of HIV or hepatitis C being put into someones system, I think that more testing on nonhuman primates will help get people on board with the idea if there are positive results.\u00a0\n        </div>",
