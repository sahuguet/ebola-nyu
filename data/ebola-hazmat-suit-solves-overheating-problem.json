      "message": "\n    \tHey Tobias, we have been cooling personnel in high heat stress environments for 17 years... Everything from Surgeons to NASCAR Drivers... We use several different cooling engines with our garments from simple Ice,Thermoelectric , Compressor Vapor Cycle and Liquid Co2. This suit has the capability to connect to all of our systems via a fixed port. It can be used with our MP2 Backpack or our 12 or 24L coolers. Our fixed systems have a auto retract hose feature that allow the person to move about without getting tangle in the hose that connects them.  If ice is not available our PROCOOL Co2 System converts liquid Co2 from a liquid to a gas through a patented manifold system and tubbing process.. Hope this helps\n    "
