      "message": "\n    \tGreat discussion! Forehead temp sensor strip seems promising. Except for the temptation to share with family and friends. Then the big question is whether sweat is vehicle for transmission. Quick look on web seems to suggest that sweat \"might\" carry the virus, but it's not known definitively, and it's speculated that the viral concentration is probably much lower than in other fluids. So it looks like the sweat question is an unknown. Just to throw out an idea: Suppose 3M corporation produced a very cheap temperature sensing tape, using liquid crystal technology. (3M are masters at producing cheap plastic  tape or film products, and they are great innovators.) So let's say the tape is dispensed from something similar to ordinary Scotch Tape dispenser. Pull out a bit of sensor tape, tear it off, use it once, then throw it away. Or maybe the dispensers aren't handled at all, but rather hang in public places. Without touching anything except the bit of tape hanging out the bottom, you pull off a piece and use it. The same sort of idea as TP in public facilities.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tInteresting idea. For me, t would have to be low cost and available in large quantity. And, most importantly, a throwaway, that is, not reusable. I have to think that the temptation to share may become a necessity if they run out and you wouldn't want something like that to be reused numerous times. Wouldn't want to contribute to potential to spread or increase risk. Science and medical community's call in the end. My focus is on changing the focus from fear to empowerment.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tAgreed, overcoming fear factor is crucial. Following detection (e.g. via temp sensor), it's an enormous challenge to motivate individual to seek medical attention. Especially if there is a prevailing perception that there is no cure. I guess two main incentives for seeking medical attention are (i) isolation will help prevent spread to family, friends and society (motivation to do this for the good of others); and (ii) there are new experimental drugs that seem to be curing patients (motivation to increase one's own chance of surviving). To address (ii), those experimental drugs being used with apparent success in the US need to be available in the affected countries. Does anyone know the status of those experimental drugs getting out in the field?\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tConcern for me with thermometers is the probably that folks would share and perhaps increase the risk overtime.  I think if temperatures were taken by a healthcare professional or trained person, that could be overcome, but if you are handing them out, a disposable single use one would be better.  I didn't look into touch free thermometers but imagine the cost would be prohibitive.  On the plastic strip, if the person has a fever they may sweat and that would be problematic because you'd possibly pass on the virus.\n    "

  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            \u00a0 In the U.S., we regularly use campaign with simple messages and actions to alert citizens to health related concerns. For the flu, we call on citizens to wash hands regularly and to get a flu shot, and we\u00a0make Flu shots available in the workplace, at the local store, and doctor's offfices for a low cost or free. We spread the message on the importance of washing hands, the correct way to sneeze, and\u00a0the difference between a cold and the flu. Hand sanitizers are available at nearly every business and in schools.\n<br/> \u00a0 Ebola is scary but can be defeated based on past history and experience. We know that it grows more contagious overtime, and the earlier it is identified the greater the chance for survival. The healthcare systems in the affected countries are not able to care for the numerous patients with advanced cases of Ebola. Any solutions need to be low cost and readily available. Citizens need to understand that Ebola can be defeated if they take action earlier.\n<br/> \u00a0 A national campaign\u00a0will educate\u00a0and\u00a0empower citizens to take action faster. A national campaigns for every citizen to check their temperature at the same time, twice\u00a0a day would be broadcast by all media and communications and could be as simple as. \"It is time to take your temperature. If it is 100 degrees take action...Ebola will not win.\" And, most importantly, the President, media personalities, teachers, managers, businesses, all stop and visibly take their temperature because Ebola is everyones' fight.\n<br/> \u00a0 Non-contact and disposable thermometers, masks, and gloves\u00a0should be made available everywhere and everyone should be encourage to keep on hand. A smartphone app to take temperatures should be made available.\n<br/> \u00a0 A multi-media campaign\u00a0should\u00a0influence citizens to change behaviors that\u00a0spread Ebola, for example, love is not a kiss or hug, but a mask and gloves to stop the spread of Ebola. Survivers of Ebola should be used to encourage citizens to check their temperatures and support the message that early detection can save lives.\n<br/> \u00a0 Bleach should\u00a0 be made available. Folks are not\u00a0wealthy and can't easily replace items. Directions on how to clean homes and personal items once Ebola had been detected should be available everywhere.\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0An Action Checklist that provides simple directions on what citizens should do\u00a0if their temperature reaches 100 degrees or higher, how to clean, and what\u00a0actions to take should be available everywhere.\n<br/> \u00a0 Smartphones could be part of the national campaign.An app to take temperatures should be free and easy to download. Also, idea of Frank Ingle could be tweaked to enable smartphones to locate citizens with fevers100 degrees or over, provide citizens with location and GPS data on nearest healthcare\u00a0facility, and to get directions on how to care\u00a0for someone suspected of having Ebola.\n<br/> \u00a0\u00a0A global campaign that encourages\u00a0us as global citizens to donate to the fight against\u00a0Ebola to\u00a0pay for the campaign kit.\n<br/> \u00a0 I will have to do more research to determine more on\u00a0what should be made available. The dehyration and fevers associated with Ebola\u00a0means there may be\u00a0specific drinks and\u00a0fever reducing drugs that may also be needed. It doesn't seem to me, a non-professional, that all patients will make it to the limited healthcare facilities. Or that the only people that survive do so under a doctor's care. I need to research what other options are available.\n<br/> So, two additional problems that a kit would need to address are dehydration and water treatment. I am including links to an article from WebMD on how to make rehydration fluids, and one from the NYTimes on Lifestraw, used to make clean drinking water. I am adding to the kit.\n<br/> http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/tc/dehydration-home-treatment\n<br/> http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/health/27straw.html?_r=0\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",

Promote via media blitz that uses slogans on how to love with mask and gloves, how to clean homes and workplace and to take action. Global campaign to provide kits containing non-contact and disposable single use thermometers, a checklist of instructions on Ebola prevention and actions, mask/gloves, and cleaning products that will be given out for free, available everywhere.",
