  "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n            In order to motivate less heroic HCW's such as myself to be more than couch crusaders, there needs to be a united front of at least 3 nurses and 1 doctor for each patient.\u00a0I didn't go to math school, but\u00a0if there are 4000 patients, that means 12000 nurses and 4000 doctors.\n<br/>\n<br/> A notice in the mail is hard to ignore since professionals are used to receiving these to renew their license.\n<br/>\n<br/> HCW's in other countries could be moblized in the same way.\n<br/>\n<br/> The expense is minimal in comparison to the alternative if Ebola is not controlled.\u00a0 Experienced RN's and doctors\u00a0 might be willing to help contain this disease in Africa if measures are in place to secure their safety. That includes at the very least; adequate staffing and an abundance of PPE.\u00a0 Building new treatment centers is fantastic, but there needs to be staff to run these centers.\n<br/>\n<br/> Upon return to their own countries, the HCW's could isolate themselves for 21 days if required.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/> \u00a0\n        </div>",
