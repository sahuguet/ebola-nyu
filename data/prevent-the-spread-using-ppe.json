You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems.

  "summary": "My daughter recently had a terrible MRSA infection and spent 5 days in the hospital receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy and wound care.  The healthcare workers rarely used PPE, mostly because the hospital was understaffed. My idea is to PREVENT Ebola by coming up with simple steps for using PPE and quarantine.  Also, creating PPE that is easy to put on and take off would be helpful, like a one-piece suit that covers face, hands...everything.",
