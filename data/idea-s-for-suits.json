I've read and heard a lot about how the suits are very hot and stuff, and was thinking if we could minimalise the manount off parts or material especially around the head it might help with leaving the suit lighter and easier to work in.\n        </div>",

  "summary": "Could we incorporate something into the design of the suits that can seal where they gloves meet the arms, could we combine a zip/ seal similar to the freezer bags? something as you twist ensures you cover the gap 360? Was also thinking cold something similar around the facemask/goggles, looking at some off them they look quite awkward with the goggles been separate...could something be put together similar to a beekeeper suit? with the goggles as part of the hood?",
