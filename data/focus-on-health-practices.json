You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

The cause for the outbreak must be identified and through that we can work towards a solution. It is also important that we find other solutions to prevent this instance from occurring in the future. Perhaps better access to clean, running water, or access to medicine and health advisers.\u00a0\n        </div>",
