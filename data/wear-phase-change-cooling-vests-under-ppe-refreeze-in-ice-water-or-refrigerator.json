We would recommend the use of Phase Change Cooling under PPE suits for a variety of reasons outlined on our IDEA page. https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/cooling-vests-to-keep-ebola-heat-care-workers-safe-from-heat-stress\n"

This and having a sipping device inside the suit will help so they can stay hydrated. Not perfect but cost effective for emergency situations.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tMoney is an issue with everything but we hope that a phase change vest can double the length of time someone in a low tech setting can stay in PPE.  This means fewer opportunities for contamination during doffing and fewer disposable PPEs that need to be burned.  Doug Frost with the TechKewl vests has some figures on his thread.https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/research/cooling-vests-for-health-care-workers-in-west-africa#c-469bfd49e7418387057ce42524574af7\n"

      "message": "\n    \tHi Jab,do I have the figures right, the cool pads weight about 5lb (2.27 kg),I can assume the heat of fusion to be in the order of 200 kJ / kg. So the vests can absorb about 450 kJ of  thermal energy. I guess they will mostly melt due to condensation of water vapor, as they are much cooler than the dew point. If the pads melt in an hour, the cooling power would be 126 W. What I do not know is how much cools the body and how much is lost.I would say, the vests should be put under a PPE in hot environment to test the cooling and to find out what the optimal configuration is.With kind regards,Rainer\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi Rainer,  these vests are already manufactured and are in use by firefighters, police, and in the case of TechKewl vests they have already been shipped to Ebola first responders.  I really don't think we need to do additional research, we just need to get them to use them and help them understand that you don't need to cool them as much as regular ice.  There are 20-30 fluid/solids that can act as phase changers.  Only 1 or 2 do so at a temperature that is bearable to human skin. Have you looked at the attached/downloadable file?  It has quite a bit of the science behind the phase change vests and probably some of the testing results you are interested in.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHi, Jab Thorn Like your idea about the PCM vests; however I wonder whether getting in ice-stocks from the city would be as easy as it sounds?  Sometimes there are considerable distances involved in transporting stocks, especially in rural areas.  What about the weight: I'm not sure the Health Workers, especially the men and women of small stature, would be keen on adding even 5 more pounds to the already cumbersome suits they wear.  Finally, are these vests constructed of materials that allow them to be disinfected - multiple times in harsh chlorine, without degrading the fabric?\n    "

It would be washed and reused just like other undergarments of the heath workers.Now the packets of PCM material themselves are just enclosed in a heavy plastic.  I don't know how that plastic would hold up.  But an option would be to put them in a ziplock bag before inserting them into the vest.  Throw away the ziplock and then a little capful of bleach in the cooler with icewater ought to be plenty.\n    "
