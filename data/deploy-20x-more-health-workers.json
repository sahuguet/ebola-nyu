If an MD or nurse wants to go to serve they might not get permission to take a prolonged leave from their employer.  (In the US as an example.)  What incentive can the government or corporate sponsors provide for these employers?  Another issue is reimbursement.  Is there a mechanism to support more health workers financially? reimbursement so that they can maintain their home base while away? (some positions currently are paid, many are voluntary.)In terms of the support and logistics that are outlined - I would think that health workers from abroad would want to know tangibles about these things.  There is a reason why health workers work with MSF for example.  They are vetted, organized and rigorous.  Last I checked they closed recruitment for this particular crisis.  I presume they are at capacity.   Perhaps their leaders can be recruited to consult?\u00a0As a health worker myself I think that as a community we are motivated by the work, the service, the need etc.   I would focus advertising on the need plus the tangible supports that will be in place to assure safety for every worker.  If there are tangible improvements to safety I would highlight every one.\n    "

If yes it would be interesting to find out what they are volunteering to do in terms of time commitment.  PIH requests a one year commitment as a paid worker, and minimum 8 weeks for voluntary work.  (read that on their site about a week ago.  maybe it has changed now?)   Are the volunteers all able to give that time commitment?  Great if they can!    I recognize that to train staff especially in this circumstance the longer commitment one can make is better.   As you dig deeper it would be interesting to find out if volunteers are able to give 2 months easily and if so are they going via a government mission such as Cuba's,  a group sent as volunteers from a medical center, a church mission etc. or primarily individual volunteers? It would also be interesting to learn whether the other necessary services are voluntary.  For example the US is mobilizing National Guard units.  Is this paid or voluntary?  (By voluntary I mean unpaid.  Clearly volunteering to go is in itself a huge help.  Loss of wages for prolonged periods of time - I am unclear if all that are mobilized in these situations are in that position.  I don't have the answers.)I read an article about MSF rejecting Australia's offer as well.  My take on it was that they are extremely frustrated by the slow response by the international community.  I did not mean to imply that health workers will need to be motivated by money.  Not at all.   I think that providing them with some renumeration so that they can afford to take a prolonged break from their work will help though.(MSF pays and provides benefits to their teams.  Reimbursement may be small but it can help sustain a home base if all provisions during the mission are already provided.  http://www.msf.ca/en/terms-employment)\n    "

Not sure what the critieria is - this is in the US.    If there are protocols being used why wouldn't any well trained MD or nurse be suitable to serve in some capacity here? (of course I understand there are certain specific reasons one would be excluded.)Can health workers  be utilized differently.  Not all health workers, even MDs and nurses, need to be in an ebola unit.  Isn't It feasible for some workers to do care for non ebola patients, community work etc etc - just like in any health system?  I agree with Rebecca that it would be beneficial for health workers to work using technology as well.  It might also be beneficial for teams on the ground to work for 3 or 4  days and then do a day of work such as this, to be able to be out of the suit for a day.  Lynn what do you think of this?  Rather than continually push one until the stress is overwhelming.Clearly everyone is calling for more workers.  Would be interesting to understand why and how in this crisis, and in others, some folk are not mobilized.\n    "

      "message": "\n    \tHello Bettina, Sheldon & Lynn,Good point, Bettina--really is key to be organized toKEEP REGULAR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES FUNCTIONING in zones where's there's (danger of or actually) a widespread ebola outbreak. The question can directly connect to larger REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES as well.First thoughts: To keep hospitals (such as MSF's in Bo, Sierra Leon) treating emergencies A MAIN TEAM with TWO DEPUTY TEAMS (government or NGO experts) would need to be added for FACILITATION OF ADAPTATION TO EBOLA CONSTRAINTS.>>>SO SUCH HOSPITALS WILL NEED *******EBOLA RESPONSE FACILITATORS/COACHES****** either onsite or by \"skype\". This FACILITATION/COACH/(even)\"HELP DESK\" TEAM will coach the hospital as to protocols, FIND FUNDS/suppliers when lacking & help with general problem-solving. In addition, this team will oversee the setting up of two key deputy teams for the hospital:FIRST A WELCOME TEAM & SECOND A CLEAN TEAM.********ON-SITE WELCOME TEAM:******** Create a welcome zone in front of the hospital where incoming patients' temperature is taken (as at airports) and in case of FEVER, a (quick) LAB TEST is done. I heard on TV some labs (US military) can test in 2 hours... IF the patient has a fever & their emergency is such that they cannot wait for lab results, EBOLA PROTOCOL would kick in as a safety precaution>>>PPE suits for operation team, hygiene (easily cleaned surfaces) for (special, simplified ebola?) operation room & isolation post-op patient care. (In case where patient can wait & lab result is negative, patient treated normally. Patients whose lab results show ebola, obviously, ebola protocol.)  EBOLA PROTOCOL could involve a separate field tent  for emergency operations & post-op adjoined to the regular hospital to help prevent contamination of primary care site.********ON-SITE CLEAN TEAM:********Takes care of (& trains local staff in) proper procedures for disposal of ebola waste (PPE, clean zoning etc.) Makes sure standard gear (hazardous materials bins, incinerators, disinfectent etc.) AND OF COURSE, sterilizing operating zones. Helps hospital adapt spaces properly.********SOME ADVICE******** A FACILITATOR/COACH/\"HELP DESK\" TEAM MIGHT WANT TO SUGGEST TO REGULAR HOSPITALS WORKING IN AN EBOLA ZONE:>>>Should ebola protocol zones be set up, PAINT WALLS of those zones in a certain \"WARNING COLOR\" so HCWs and others immediately see where/where not to go.>>>Heat sensing bracelets revealing temperature (by changing color) of the wearer should be worn at all times (in hospital, but also in ebola regions?) to indicate a possible case being declared---in which case patient isolated &  lab test done. >>>Colored hospital bracelets on patients should clearly indicate illness categories: non-infected, awaiting lab results, early infection, declared infection & recovering...key dates could be indicated here.>>>Keep track of laboratory testing needs for flying labs (in trucks or helicopters, or...) to quickly be present where needed.>>>Facilitating teams (on or off-site--like a \"help desk\") should work with local suppliers when they can & try different materials/options...such DECENTRALIZATION of response can serve as testing ground to quickly see WHAT WORKS BEST.>>>Facilitator team should have a \"basics\" video to show to all hospital staff who must adapt to ebola protocol >>>FEEDBACK PROTOCOL (through facilitator or other)  needs to be integrated to quickly make global community aware of proper solutions or practices to improve.\n    "

It's not easy convincing health professionals from better resourced countries to take such a personal risk, but many may want to help if they receive appropriate support.\n<br/>\n<br/> We could think more creatively about who to target in our recruitment drives, such as: \n<ul>\n<li><strong>African diaspora</strong>: Many health workers with roots in Africa are trained and/or working abroad have both the skills and the interest in contributing.</li>\n<li><strong>African countries</strong>: The ECOWAS and the African Union should also help better resourced member states to temporarily provide health workers.</li>\n<li><strong>Lay health workers</strong>: People without professional health qualifications might be provided with basic training to assist with Ebola prevention, treatment and care or other roles (e.g. cooks, sanitation, translators, drivers). Ideally, these should be <a href=\"https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/train-and-employ-ebola-survivors-as-health-workers-they-are-immune-to-ebola-so-no-need-for-full-ppe-and-stigmatized-in-home-communities-so-would-probably-love-to-re-make-their-image-as-helpers-and-heroes\">Ebola survivors</a> who have immunity.</li>\n<li><strong>Remote specialists</strong>: Health professionals with rare but crucial skills who aren't willing or able to provide face-to-face consultations could be connected with local health teams via video conferencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/> We could also explore ways of getting international corporations more involved and offering sponsorship and pro bono work, like: \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recruitment agencies</strong> - setting recruitment criteria, headhunting health workers more likely to be interested and designing orientation packages.</li>\n<li><strong>Advertising agencies </strong>- developing communication strategies to support recruitment and <a href=\"https://openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/enhance-the-image-and-reputation-of-local-health-workers-ambulance-teams-and-those-who-burry-the-death\">promote the role of emergency workers</a></li>\n<li><strong>Media outlets</strong> - providing pro bono air time for advertising.</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance companies</strong> - developing high risk insurance packages for health workers that can be sponsored by donors.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/> While I am focusing on recruitment here, we can't ignore the importance of: \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advocacy</strong> and lobbying for international political support (e.g. international donor countries, development partners, ECOWAS, African Union)</li>\n<li>Rapid <strong>training</strong> and orientation on Ebola and host country contexts</li>\n<li><strong>Joint management</strong> bodies to coordinate deployment</li>\n<li>Adequate mobile <strong>equipment</strong> and work areas for infection prevention, diagnosis and treatment</li>\n<li>Health care <strong>support services</strong> (e.g. transport, catering, accomodation, maintenance, security, translation, data management, supply chain management)</li>\n<li><strong>Personal care</strong> for health teams (e.g counselling, health care, relaxation, communications, insurance, incentives)</li>\n</ul>\n<br/> I'm always amazed by what some people will do to care for others in the face of tradgedy and enormous obstacles.\n        </div>",
