You should be able to use the Update Entry button on the right of your post and follow the instructions to add images from there. We know occasionally people have issues uploading images so let us know by hitting the Feedback button at the bottom of most pages of our site if you face any problems. Looking forward to seeing more of your inspiring insights on OpenIDEO. And here's some tips on adding visual goodness to your idea: http://ideo.pn/vis-uals plus more on evolving your thought-starter: http://ideo.pn/oi-evolve\n"

      "message": "\n    \tHi John--Great idea! Most Health Care Workers (HCWs) are experiencing that they can't last in a suit for more than 40 minutes before starting to experience heat exhaustion. Using interested ebola survivors to assist would be a great way to build capacity without increasing the exposure risk.You could use survivors as everything from direct-contact patient emotional support to (as you said above), being hands for remote physicians. Separate quarters and decontamination stations might be needed to keep immune survivors from accidentally bringing a contaminant outside of the quarantine, but that's certainly a solvable issue, and they wouldn't need be limited by the 40 minute window. Might be safer in the long run than changing out of a suit multiple times per day.\n    "

Assuming survivors have a strong immunity (this would need verification) they could assist in the treatment of the infected with reduced risk.  In that the infections in the West have been of health workers,  using health care workers who are Ebola survivors may help prevent new infections.
